Politics is one of the toughest vocations, says Card BurkeCardinal Burke offers St Thomas More as model for SPUC youth, a martyr for obedience in conscience to the moral law, without compromiseTrue understanding of conscience (recognition of truth) held by the Church, in contrast to the world's false understanding (relativism)Connection between justice and purity/chastity, says Card. Burke. Essential procreative nature of conjugal act. Contraception is anti-lifeCard Burke cites BXVI 2010 Xmas address calling for generous &amp; selfless obedience to the moral law in response  to crisis in the WestNo such thing as "alternative sexualities", only sexuality as enshrined by God in human nature, says Cardinal Burke at SPUC youth conferenceCardinal Burke: family home is "the cradle of life". Crisis of Christian culture in the West. "Wholesale murder of the baby in the womb"Cardinal Burke starts his address SPUC youth conference at Southport. Says he has long admired SPUC, its work and its CEO John Smeaton."Attend, attend, make a friend" is how pro-lifers at UN. SPUC works closely with Holy See at UN. Call for #prolife youth to get involved.Pat Buckley, one of SPUC's reps at United Nations, says SPUC has been key for decades in stopping abortion being declared human right by UNGeneral decrease of risky behaviour (smoking, drinking, drugs) among teens. School sex ed has little/no effect on abortion, teen preg ratesLong-acting reversible contraception (LARC) has had little/no impact on teen preg or abortion rates. Morning after pill no effect either.Pro-abort meme that nothing will change teens' minds re having sex is contradicted by stats, says academic David Paton to SPUC youth todayDrop in rate of teen abortions since 2008 coincides with winding-down of govt's Teenage Pregnancy Strategy, says Prof. David Paton to SPUCProf. David Paton now speaking on link between abortion and sex ed.

Need 4 declaration of total resistance 2 abortion. Emergency calls 4 open prayer.Theologians who dissent from Catholic teaching on abortion undermine pro-life fight. Failure of bishops to discipline them thus harms cause.Pro-life orgs can't defeat culture of death on our own. We need global strength &amp; reach of Catholic Church leadership to back us solidlyObama made abortion promotion worldwide, incl. to schoolchildren thru sex ed, one of his 1st priorities. We need strong RC Church to help usRight that SPUC concerned re what happens in Catholic Church b/c Church incl. some great clergy gives great strength to pro-life movementSPUC defended pro-life counsellors when they were spied upon &amp; defamed by pro-abortion groups via media fellow-travellers.As Dr William Newton showed, contraceptive mentality is at root (not merely fruit) of culture of death e.g. abortion.Some pro-life orgs (incl. SPUC in past) wasted efforts arguing for wrong legislation e.g. compromise bills. Let's never make mistake again.SPUC's chief exec John Smeaton thanking youth delegates from Romania, US, Scotland. Youth part of pro-life movement much more advanced 2daySPUC youth delegates now enjoying video highlights of last nite's ceilidh (Irish dancing).Heartfelt thanks to Pat Buckley &amp; Peter C Smith for their sterling work at UN for SPUC &amp; helping Holy See et al. to fight for life &amp; familyPro-abortion lobby identifies Catholic Church, esp. Holy See delegation at UN, as main roadblock to advance of global anti-life agendaPro-abortion, anti-family Estrela report in Euro Parliament was defeated cos it exceeded Euro Parl's competence, plus big pro-life push-backNew Irish abortion law allows abortion up to birth in some cases; forces medics &amp; hospitals to be complicit in abortion.PM Enda Kenny broke pre-election promise not to legislate to allow abortion. Pro-abortion lies re Savita case increased pressure on DailRuling of Euro Court of Human Rights in Tysiac v Poland case was used later in same court in A, B &amp; C case to pressure Ireland over abortionJohn Paul II, who lived thru Nazi occupation, said pro-abortion culture of death is more insidious &amp; evil than Nazi culture of deathUN human rights declarations, conventions etc actually protect unborn children from abortion but pro-aborts at UN misrepresent themNuremberg trials declared abortion (whether voluntary or forced) to be "crime against humanity", "act of extermination"John Smeaton, SPUC's chief exec, now introducing Pat Buckley, SPUC's man in Ireland; with Peter C Smith, one of SPUC's representatives at UNRT @JackStukel: People like Fiorella Nash restore my faith in human sanity and compassion @spucprolife #fourthwave #feminismBe bold, be active, be compassionate, be a man. Fiorella Nash concludes talk on "Men and abortion", to SPUC youth conferenceBe concerned about common good; work with others; find common ground; don't be scaredBe with women during crisis pregnacies; speak respectfully to and about women; be confident in giving pro-life opinion, show compassionHow should men work to stop abortion? Live life of personal integrity, not selective morality, don't sleep around, don't abandon womenAbortion leads to relationship breakdown, contrary to promises of abortion advocates. Denial of abortion loss common early-stage bereavement"Silent No More" help both men &amp; women after abortion experience. One Army veteran: "I still grieve for [my aborted son]." Lost chances.Men suffering from partners' abortions of their children, mocked by pro-abortion feminists. Depression, substance abuse, helplessness.RU486 is hit-and-run abortion, leaving women to deal with the appalling trauma of delivery &amp; disposal of dead baby.SPUC's Fiorella Nash now speaking on "Men and abortion".

Great dinner &amp; dancing last nite, religious services this a.m.RT @AdamCC92: SPUC conference has been absolutely amazing! They do such great workSPUC's Pro-Life Chains on 27 April, anniversary of Abortion Act coming into effect. Call SPUC on 020 7091 7091 for more info.Now hearing from Eve Farren of the Alliance of Pro-Life Students; SPUC Scotland's Project Truth and pro-life roadshow.Religious arguments not essential to show wrongness of abortion but can help give deeper, broader context for understanding wrongness.Argument that unborn human is parasite never used by scientists to describe unborn of animal species. Shows anti-human bias.If unborn was not a human being, it couldn't develop those capacities which are identifiably human. Mother's body welcomes human being.Abortion is a violent separation of child from mother, not simply decision not to support another's life. Abortion = deliberate killing.Dr Helen Watt now answering question by rebutting Judith Jarvis Thompson's famous violinist scenario. Pregnancy very different situation.Ethical use of double-effect re abortion requires strong justification. Is pregnancy a special case? From mock debate, SPUC youth conferenceMock debate now going through arguments around twinning, ensoulment. Aquinas good on soul-body but used now-outdated embryologyDistinction between killing and letting die. Legitimate choices about resource allocation not intentional homicide.Argument: direct abortions and double effect abortions not really that different, so why not give jail time for both? Dr Helen Watt to replyPro-aborts argue not all human beings are persons. Right to life not in play for unborn cos not persons. From mock debate at SPUC conferenceAnother anti-life argument is healthcare rationing e.g. focus on saving those deemed to have most life in front of them.Anthony McCarthy, in mock debate, now presenting arguments given for some abortions e.g. to save babies when one cannot save all.Society must change to accommodate fertility, not make women non-mothers to fit society's perceived needs, says Dr Watt to SPUC conference.Dr Helen Watt and Anthony McCarthy now in mock debate on "Is abortion always wrong?" Dr Watt giving #prolife side. Pregnant women = mothersAbortion providers doling out operations, pills, drugs, devices which give men cover, excuses to abuse women further. Women deserve better.Many men hurt, angry, emasculated by partner's abortion. Women patronised by abortion lobby, as incapable of responsible motherhood.Panel on male &amp; female perspectives on abortion. Fiorella Nash, John-Henry Westen, Pravin Thevasathan, Robin Haig, Anthony Ozimic (chair)RT @crismunozbe: Around 140 young adults attending the Youth Prolife Conference at Telford,England cc @spucprolifePro-abortion David Fergusson defended pro-life Dr Patricia Coleman's work showing negative psychological effects of abortion.Dr Pravin Thevasathan, consultant psychiatrist, now speaking on psychological issues around abortion. Powerful studies by David FergussonPrinters, sports presenters et al. in Canada being sacked for not going along with gay agenda. Some Catholic bishops complicit in agenda.Love is the easiest way for pro-lifers to get through to our opponents, esp. those hurt by harmful lifestyles (abortion, homosexuality etc)Cardinal Ratzinger told US bishops: pro-abortion politicians must be denied Holy Communion, out of love for their souls and truth re life.Satan attacks married love cos God has made married love the exemplar of Heaven, John-Henry Westen telling SPUC youth conference.Pro-family movement is movement of love, though unpopular; gets false accusations of "hatred", "bigotry"; also anti-faith hostility.Women like http://t.co/a7rsBtatqr have found love, healing, hope in #prolife cause. Pro-lifers using love to move beyond standard debatesPro-life message of love for both mother and child is having beautiful effect, says John-Henry Westen of http://t.co/oTh7hRsyUo to SPUC.Both founders of http://t.co/oTh7hRsyUo used to live pro-abortion, sexually liberal lifestyle.Soon realised it was a narrow hell.Young pro-lifers called to be heroic, just like good people during the Holocaust.  Abortion holocaust: 10s of millions killed every year.Pro-abortion and anti-family movements have long been cooperating. Media totally misrepresenting prayer vigils as angry, condemnatory.John-Henry Westen, co-founder &amp; editor-in-chief of http://t.co/oTh7hRsyUo, now speaking to SPUC's 7th Int'l Pro-life Youth conference.RT @LaCatholicState: @spucprolife  but more importantly....the Church states that parents are the primary educators.  Never know when the U…RT @spucscotland: Project Truth stall @ the SPUC Youth Conference http://t.co/KDwp6ohyIlParents will become victims of the very ideas which they treat with indifference. John Paul II: all policies for the family, not at its costIn Germany, home-schooling families arrested, children taken away, forced into exile. Good parents just protecting their kids from bad ideasApart from a few brave bishops past &amp; present, most bishops have failed to protect parents, thus damaging individual families, says Dr Ward.Dr Tom Ward to young pro-lifers: don't make same mistakes of previous generations in ignoring role of parents.Unlike pro-aborts, pro-lifers slow to realise that culture of death is underlined by contraception and homosexuality as well as abortionEnemies of pro-life know that parents as 1st educators are bulwarks vs abortion agenda. Pro-life movement slow to catch-up with this fact.Other anti-family radicals: Karl Marx, Lady Helen Brook. Agenda: take away children from parents' influence and give them to State instead.Saul Alinsky was anti-family radical who dedicated book to Satan. Obama, Hillary Clinton are Alinsky's disciples.UN Declaration of Human Rights upholds parents' rights as primary educators as safeguard vs child indoctrination e.g. Nazi schooling.Dr Tom Ward now speaking on: "Parents, the first pro-life teachers." Pays tribute to SPUC as unrivalled in Europe in importance for pro-lifeChildren of women who considered but didn't choose abortion have thanked SPUC for saving their lives. SPUC gave support, love. U can too.Myths: all abortion banned before '67, when abortion legalised. Facts: some abortion allowed '40s - '60s, abortion still crime in law.RT @CCFather: Bernie reports from @spucprolife youth conference: excellent morning, esp William Newton.Robin Haig, SPUC chairman, ex-chairman of Association of Lawyers in Defence of the Unborn (ALDU) dispelling myths re British abortion lawVery important to provide emotional support to women considering abortion or post-abortion, says Dr Helen Watt at SPUC youth conference.Dr Helen Watt: Men have everything to do with abortion because they have everything to do with how women get pregnant.Contraceptive sex doesn't give full soul-body union to sexual partner. Also, gift of fertility to spouse different to other gifts to others.Contraception leads to dualistic view of human person, denying essential unity of soul and body, Dr William Newton at SPUC youth conferenceExtra-marital sex endemic in today's world, partly due to contraception. Illicit sex common in some eras, but esp. rampant today.Natural family planning (NFP) differs from contraception because NFP is open to life, simply making use of infertile part of cycle.Matters what type of people we become through our actions. Aim to follow our vocation w/out wrongful cooperation in evil, concludes Dr WattAvoiding scandal (e.g. giving impression of weak/absent opposition to abortion) requires prudence. Again, can depend on closeness/remotenessMaterial (as distinct from formal) cooperation in evil often (but not always) wrong. Depends on how close or remote to formal cooperation.Regulation of legal abortion inevitably involves formal cooperation in evil. Wrong to tell women how to prepare for abortion, says Dr WattPro-lifers must remember: ends don't justify means. All our intentions must be good, not just some. One area of concern: abortion law reformDr Helen Watt of Anscombe Bioethics Centre speaking on "Cooperation with evil: how to think about the issue", at SPUC youth conference.@enolastevenson Yes.Dr William Newton just concluded talk on deep logical links between contraception and abortion, to SPUC's 7th Int'l youth conference.Moral blindness caused by selfishness of contraceptive (i.e. loveless) sex, porn etc leads to failure to recognise humanity of the unborn.Connection of the virtues: Lack of temperance inherent in contraception leads to selfishness, removes motivation to be sexually selfless.In teaching of moral theology in most Catholic colleges, contraception is core issue which has corrupted thinking about moral absolutes.Science increasingly uninterested in question of its relationship with common good. Contraception wants power to neuter (not aid) nature.Contraception treats humans as if they are animals e.g. sterilising them if they breed too much. Tells people they can't control themselvesContraception enculturates mentality that pregnancy is like a disease. If "drug" of contraception fails, one kills the "disease" (unborn)Contraception leads to people taking risks with sex, and sleeping with people they wouldn't want to have children with. More teen pregnancyContraception trivialises sex by removing the profound aspect of it, which is procreation.Contraception is a game-changer in how society thinks about sex, human life, the person, science and morality.Contraception not practical solution to abortion, let alone moral solution, says Dr William Newton at SPUC youth conference this a.m.Contraceptive mentality is: more sex, no kids. Leads to unplanned kids being seen as unwanted, thus leveraging abortion.Fact: Big increase in contraceptive use was paralled by big increase in abortion in Spain, Turkey etc.Top Catholic academic Dr William Newton about to speak on 'Contraception and Abortion: Humanae Vitae and Evangelium Vitae".Good morning from 2nd day of 7th SPUC Int'l Pro-life Youth Conference,  Telford, England.
