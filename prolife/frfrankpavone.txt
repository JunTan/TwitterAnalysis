"By their fruits you will know them," the Lord said. #PresidentialDebate #debateNotice - Mr. Trump referred to the Constitution of the United States, and to specific amendments rather than invented rights #Debate2016On this question of the Supreme Court, did you hear Mrs. Clinton say the word "Constitution" once? #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016Mrs Clinton - the Supreme Court has whittled away at Roe vs. Wade for decades, don't you know that? #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016Hillary, the justices have to understand the US Constitution, not the way "the world" works. #PresidentialDebate #Debate2016Deplorable and irredeemable - yes, she does mean that about conservatives, as does all the Left. #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016Sure, Hillary, the Trump effect increases bullying, but no abortion effect? No coarsening of respect for life? #Debates2016If a politician can't respect the life of a little baby (like those in the womb), how can they respect children? #PresidentialDebateTrump is resonating with voters who are sick of media bias and sick of words only, no action. #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016Well that was interesting...Now the moderator is debating the candidate. #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016What exactly is the mindset that says we welcome all these people in -- but don't welcome unborn children? #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016In the Democrat worldview, only those are included whose right to life they decide to recognize. #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016John Paul II said the same thing -- we have to call things by their proper name! Look evil in the eye. #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016Now I understand... As far as Hillary is concerned, anything said against her is a lie -- and we're just supposed to take her word for it.Hillary - amazing - he decided to talk about the tapes and not policy? Were you asleep the last 20 minutes. #debate2016 #PresidentialDebateHow many people in America are as upset about dismembering babies as by vulgar speech -- and exactly which is worse?What a hypocrite. "This is not who we are." Right, we are not a nation that treats children as garbage.Oh, Hillary is so upset by immorality... Ask her one question about the immorality of saying children have no constitutional rightsor men marrying menCan someone be fit to serve if they institutionalize immoral behavior -- such as policies that allow women to be dismembered in the wombAnderson Cooper believes in public confession..Institutionalized bad behavior includes the things that Trump is saying now. #PresidentialDebate #debate2016As the bishops have also said, "We get the public officials we deserve."

#debate #DebateNightGun violence... Yes, lots of guns are coming to confession these days... Guns don't commit violence; people doRT @operationrescue: We KNOE Clinton has a lot to hide - like the contents of 30,000 emails. Like selling access thru her foundation. Etc.This clear straight talk is what Americans want and need to hearWhere are the audits of the Clinton Foundation?Smart to keep focusing on country in wrong direction and do-nothing politiciansSo is Clinton's presumption here that she's part of the "wealthy" or not?I like how low key the moderator is so farHope she mentions her husband even more... Big mistakeTrump is talking specifics; Clinton isn't and is just criticizing himIt's smart to use the name Clinton instead of Hillary- reminds people of the past"America's direction" will be a key segment for social issuesLord, bless all the viewers of this event and open their ears to the truth about these candidatesIf people pay more attention to the candidates than the commentators they'll be better offRT @ProLifeNation: Are you ready to rumble????Trump family is beautiful...
