I have one book on order with a woman as a co-author, and that’s it. 😕I’d like to think I get a reasonable spread of authors in my general reading, but the technical side needs work. Recommendations welcome.@IslaStevens What’s the Scottish word for “trouble”? 🙂I’m putting together some book recommendations for a maths student, and it’s almost all male authors.

(Why did I even ask?) But yay for finding the old tablets, I guess?@IslaStevens Joking aside, *hugs* and hope you feel better soon. &lt;3@IslaStevens *slow clap*

Have you done anything about it since that conversation, or did you go straight to tweeting about it?@ddbeck Very nice! I’m curious, how did you getthere – car? Train?

I’m glad to be back to liking it.I’ve been doing some plane geometry in the last few days, and I’m enjoying it so much.

You almost managed to say that with a straight face, y’know.@o_guest Okay, I’ll grant you that. I’m quite proud of my British accent. 😊@IslaStevens ICYMI, you’re not the only one to screw up the date of somebody’s birthday. 😂 https://t.co/EvGgyPfbUCTrying to resist doing a @DRMacIver and breaking out integer linear programming for rearranging the desks at work… (https://t.co/Mbjb5WY4RC)…and look what just appeared at the top of my “books I want to read” list. https://t.co/Qyvyrqmq1V@ghickman They changed what counts in the 140 chars – IIRC, quotes, links, images now come “for free”. Probably the associated API changes.@russel_winder Courtesy of @DjangoGirlsPyUK. Hopefully coming to their online store soon.Back at work today, but feeling relaxed and refreshed by #PyConUK. 🙂@o_guest @ohshitgit Yep, seen it, and deployed strategically to several Git users. Handy resource. 🙂One weirdness in the new @github UI: doesn’t seem like I can edit the overall comment for a code review. So guess where I just made a typo…@o_guest Will this be posted somewhere publicly accessible? We can’t all be fancypants academics. 😉Nice touch in @Twitterrific: when suggesting an @-reply, prioritises people I know/follow. I’m surprised that web!Twitter doesn’t do that.@supergirl_sass That’s totally how it works.@supergirl_sass *facepalm* That’s the second time I’ve done this to somebody this year. Oh well, hope today’s great too! 😉@supergirl_sass If I’ve done timezones right, it’s your birthday in Australia by now. So, Happy Birthday! Hope you have a great day! 🎂🎉@o_guest @CelineBoudier @RaeKnowler @DRMacIver I’m still confused by the idea I have a “dad voice”, but *shrug*. Go with the flow, I guess.And hey, look at that, a conference that started doing a quiet room just today. 😄 https://t.co/mkyiGekKzrHere’s another personal highlight of #PyConUK: the quiet room. Every conference should have one. https://t.co/rqYtDbcwMF@o_guest I haven’t opened my laptop all day, so notifications have been piling up in this tab. That’s… a lot. 😯 https://t.co/DtowlNqHQqTonight: eat dinner, finish writing up my diary entries from PyCon, then start watching the new series of #Carmilla (finally!).@charwarz @AldiUK According to the flier I got through the door today, Histon Road store reopens on Thursday.@RaeKnowler @DRMacIver @o_guest Being undead or non-corporeal is not an acceptable excuse for violating the code of conduct.@o_guest @DRMacIver @RaeKnowler Oh, so is *that* why you were all being mean to me this week? Vampires deserve safe spaces too, y’know.@o_guest @PyConUK Any rumours of vampires on the A/V team are unfounded in reality.@o_guest @PyConUK Plan is to get the session videos posted within a fortnight, but not all done yet – the A/V team are only human!@DRMacIver @o_guest Also, 14 more notifications spawned from that one tweet. 🙃@DRMacIver @o_guest Riiiiiight. Got it now. Although I’d say the conference *and* the friends are worth something, right? 🙂I get home from PyCon, and then find a handwritten letter from a uni friend waiting for me (#oldfashioned). Truly, what a lovely few days.@charwarz FYI, I brought a spare badge back to Cambridge. Yours the next time I see you. https://t.co/ozmcSqvpPz@DRMacIver @o_guest I hope so too, but I was expecting Twitter to calm down a bit!

(Also, is that a reference? If so, over my head, oops.)@o_guest I go offline, and come back to this. You know the conference is over, right? 😝 https://t.co/8AnCqV6E3V@IslaStevens Sadly, I did see that. I’m not proud of our dark history, crowing about it doubly so.@IslaStevens Are there any conferences about the environment? Recorded conferences talks make for great late night watching.@IslaStevens Yes, and then some. At least in this country, I hear echoes of the British Empire.@DRMacIver @o_guest @rgaiacs *puts away organiser hat* I’ll let it pass… this time. 😉@ddbeck okay, okay, but “put coin in shoe”? Haven’t heard that one before.Although I’m sad to be home from PyCon, I have company, so things aren’t all bad. https://t.co/zPKOPWudlq@o_guest @rgaiacs It’s your fault for not taking me up on the offer of blank badges I’d found. 😛@ddbeck check your phone is silenced? 🙂RT @jessysaurusrex: Managing a personal Slack room and a work one too? Give them custom color schemes. The color coding is your friend.RT @PyConUK: Our conference code of conduct report: https://t.co/zo48PPxmXE@Samathy_Barratt @PyConUK It was so great to meet you this week! So glad you enjoyed the conference. &lt;3@GailOllis @o_guest @PyConUK I don’t think Twitter is ideal, because not everybody is on Twitter. But definitely a possibility..@evildmp, @inglesp and many others worked incredibly hard to create #PyConUK 2016. Thanks for a great event! https://t.co/3OVryTnUGI@DRMacIver @CelineBoudier @o_guest @Samathy_Barratt @rgaiacs @drvinceknight @drjtwit @NikoletaGlyn Same time next year? 🙂🐍 #PyConUKMy first #PyConUK has been wonderful. So many new friends, such lovely &amp; nice people. Alas, time to go home; but already excited about 2017.RT @Samathy_Barratt: "Diversity in Tech is like canaries in a mine.

I know that has some presentation modes. (From where I sit, often hard to distinguish the two!)RT @helenst: Not cool :( https://t.co/FGAJyxILN2OH: “Yes, he’s debugging his trousers.” #PyConUK@o_guest IMO, the 2016 CoC is much better – more detailed and specific, and gives organisers more teeth to deal with offenders.@o_guest 2015 is CC BY-NC-SA 3.0, 2016 is CC BY 3.0 (according to the websites).@o_guest @mjsandells @sciremotesense Had a CoC in 2015 (https://t.co/Sgq1IXaM2V), not sure about 2014, significantly beefed up for 2016.@kkvie reveal.js, which has a default text size that’s way to small. &lt;/soapbox&gt; #PyConUK@laliandra Ah, I was a bit thrown by the “avatar” mention. I’ll check out the show, thanks!@DRMacIver Ah, I was a bit confused by the “avatar” mention.Too many talks with tiny, hard-to-read text at #PyConUK. I smell the bad defaults of reveal.js. 😕LRT: I think that’s a Star Wars reference, but honestly not sure.RT @DRMacIver: @alexwlchan only the avatar can master all three badges and bring balance to the conference?Finally I have the full set of #PyConUK badges! https://t.co/joNwu8qAl0@Samathy_Barratt (And as somebody who’s had to walk out of several talks for red badge/admin stuff, I feel super guilty every time.)@Samathy_Barratt I know it doesn’t make you feel better, but it happens to everyone, and it’s often external stuff – not talk-related.@o_guest @GailOllis @PyConUK And pre-screening the questions (index cards or otherwise) is something we are *strongly* considering.@o_guest @GailOllis @PyConUK Now I’m less frantic: we are thinking carefully about how we might change the questions next year.@garethQrees Oh damn. I missed the UK. Blasted Apache config! Will fix, thanks!Thanks to everybody who came to my Hypothesis talk! Slides are available here: https://t.co/SgKBUJcr59 #PyConUK@GailOllis @o_guest @PyConUK We are thinking about this (about to talk, will reply properly later)@o_guest I have a blank blue ticket waiting for youBeing serious, this talk by @DRMacIver on using linear programming to schedule conference talks is super interesting. Lots of uses. #PyConUKI think @DRMacIver is currently volunteering to write the #PyConUK schedule next year… 😈RT @Lukasaoz: Running a conference is hard work for poor overworked organisers. #PyConUK https://t.co/Te7iUIQth1@ricardoz17 @DRMacIver Have a lie inShameless plug: if you’re at #PyConUK, I’m talking about Hypothesis, property-based testing and how to make code more robust after lunch.@Samathy_Barratt Since you were asking: these are our guidelines for dealing with code of conduct violations: https://t.co/NO5czAXUkE@o_guest Okay. Crisis averted. Phew!@o_guest (this is an invitation for you to point them out to me)@o_guest Err… just checked the site. I can’t see the differences?@o_guest …I will get that fixedAnd something I hadn’t considered – very useful for international visitors, for whom English might not be their first language. #PyConUK“We thought it was a bit of a luxury, a bit of an expense, but something worth doing.” – @evildmp on live captioning. #PyConUKRT @drakekin: "Because IRC didn't render Arabic, we had to mix Arabic and English, making Arabish." #PyConUKRT @o_guest: Introducing Django to the Foreign World @_Bashar #PyConUK https://t.co/zYUZoqReSKFirst post from #PyConUK: why I’m so grateful for live captioning/STTR, and every conference should have it. https://t.co/4RJkMTHqaB #a11yRT @RaeKnowler: It is so very nice to mention that my pronouns are gender-neutral and have *nobody* start a "debate" on the topic. 💙 #PyCon…@drvinceknight Writing a short blog post about the STTR – may I use this image to illustrate what the screens look like?And some talk highlights today: @aaronbassett on packaging/security, @ccdesales on legacy codebases, and @helenst on PyCon 🇿🇼. #PyConUKDay 3 of #PyConUK: I talked to more new people! Who were all lovely and nice and I feel really good. Draining (oops introvert) but happy. &lt;3@IslaStevens So the kittens are bound to get along with one of them, right? 😛@IslaStevens N’awwww, unusual for it to be that way round – but I guess the kittens barely register the big cats at this point?@IslaStevens How does your other cat feel about hem? 🐱@o_guest Well, then save the tweet, and look at it in the middle of the night. &lt;3@IslaStevens N’awwwwwwww KITTENS. 😄@_tomchristie Whole bunch of us heading down – planning in the #social channel on the conference Slack@Hananobira If you’re in middle-of-nowhere Texas with likely patchy cell coverage, isn’t a paper map potentially quite useful?@o_guest If it makes you feel better, I don’t hate you? Those feelings suck. *offers hugs* &lt;3One of the best parts of #PyConUK: a quiet room. Sessions and conversations are great, but having a place to retreat/recharge is so useful.RT @Ramblin_Dave: @Ramblin_Dave in fact, I'm generally blown away by all the efforts to make #pyconuk safe, inclusive, accessible and just…TIL about pip-tools (https://t.co/EE3qlxJpBo). Looks super useful – from a great talk about packaging problems by @aaronbassett. #PyConUKRT @drakekin: "Software maintenance is the raffle of a tiger, you've won the prize, it's dangerous and you don't want it." #PyConUK@kjam @DRMacIver Yes. Yes. Yes.

I like that metaphor (from a talk about neurodiversity).RT @DjangoGirlsPyUK: We now have a stall at up @PyConUK just outside the assembly room , come and pick up a badge and some stickers!😍🤗 http…RT @ntoll: A magnificent hall ready for an equally magnificent @PyConUK https://t.co/Scjkg75KNf@charwarz @DjangoGirlsPyUK I think there might have been extras; I’ll check the stand tomorrow morning.Plus meeting lots of cool new people, catching a few great talks, and generally getting to geek out about Python. Bring on day 2! #PyConUKSo day 1 of #PyConUK was mostly spent helping at @DjangoGirlsPyUK, which was super fun. 😄 https://t.co/ixKUQg7HrM@shehulking *hugs* &lt;333Heading to the Bute building for the start of #PyConUK, and look whose statue I spotted on the streets of Cardiff. https://t.co/GOgBs7on9K@gouwens PerfectA mere eight hours later, Cardiff. And now, bed. https://t.co/jm2srcmR6ADriving to #PyConUK, and there’s a snail making its way across the windscreen. While going at nearly 70mph. Wut. https://t.co/hMy9mZgEVELondon is roasting, but I’m finally setting off for #PyConUK. 😄@shehulking *hugs* &lt;333333The weather forecast for @PyConUK features no rain. NO RAIN. In Cardiff. (I miss rain in Cambridge, a lot.)

Wales, you disappoint me.@PyConUK Heh, no rush. Just wanted to make sure I hadn’t missed something. 🙂(So no prizes for guessing what I’ll be listening to as I drive to @PyConUK on Wednesday)I really like the new @wardthomasmusic album “Cartwheels”. Whole set is lovely and beautifully sung, with tracks 9 and 11 as personal faves.@PyConUK When should I get worried if I haven’t had an invitation yet? 🙂@Hananobira If you still hear hissing, may be a coolant leak (which would explain the overdrive). Look for marks on the fridge interior.@Hananobira Was the door properly closed last night? Any breaks or ruptures in the door seal?@Hananobira Looks like it might not be cooling properly – if heat gets in, the cooling elements kick into overdrive, and you get frost.RT @mllelal: This is like quite all over again holy crap https://t.co/FEIRMZzQqh@croissantkatie Anybody would think you all liked sports or something.I want to send someone a Get Well Soon card, and I only have Christmas cards. Remind me of this when I’m stalling on cards this year.@croissantkatie *offers hugs and tea*@raymondh The same as `x = 10`?

And it’s better for everyone if you make a full recovery before returning to work.The more I try other package managers, the more I appreciate the simplicity of Cargo in #Rustlang.
