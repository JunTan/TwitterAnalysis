I wasn't aware there was a misunderstanding between us, No problem.@gtpeople @BlissTabitha @patfo49 My power is going to go. Experiencing a severe thunderstorm. Bye for now.@gtpeople @BlissTabitha @patfo49 But, I brought up the apple idea to argue how ideas can make things worse - rotting.@gtpeople @BlissTabitha @patfo49 But, arguing "new ideas" now, provides no sense of that-sounds-right as a good solution, only a bad one.@gtpeople @BlissTabitha @patfo49 You haven't yet argued that Cubans would be free(?) if isolationism hadn't occurred, other than "ideas".@gtpeople @BlissTabitha @patfo49 Over Isolationism?@gtpeople @BlissTabitha @patfo49 What was that challenge?@gtpeople @BlissTabitha @patfo49 It seems like you are changing the channel to divert the debate.@gtpeople @BlissTabitha @patfo49 We agree, but I'm wondering why you mention it. Is there a reason?@gtpeople @BlissTabitha @patfo49 I don not understand your statement?@gtpeople @BlissTabitha @patfo49 You must challenge ideas (Socratic method) to find all the faults.@gtpeople @BlissTabitha @patfo49 A parliamentary system, just like a republic (America), is adversarial. It's the basis of jurisprudence.@gtpeople @BlissTabitha @patfo49 Yes, but you have to take care of it, without getting resistance. Bad ideas deserve resistance.@gtpeople @BlissTabitha @patfo49 You realize that your response here lacks sustenance (pun intended). It appears you are reaching here.@gtpeople @BlissTabitha @patfo49 No problem. Thanks for taking the time. We will have to agree to disagree.@gtpeople @BlissTabitha @patfo49 Yes, but those ideas changed things for the worse.

Why are they so mad at you?@BlissTabitha @patfo49 @gtpeople Malkin is great, except when using ad hominems. Two wrongs .... And, it's wrong for lefties to do it.@patfo49 @BlissTabitha Thank you for revealing I was wrong to thinking you were criticizing me. I genuinely appreciate the correction.@BlissTabitha @patfo49 @gtpeople There is a difference between accurately revealing how wrong someone is and condemnation them.@BlissTabitha @patfo49 @gtpeople Is that what Christ would do?@BlissTabitha @patfo49 @gtpeople I understand. But, no matter how wrong Jack is, unless he is more evil than I, I shouldn't condemn him?@BlissTabitha @patfo49 @gtpeople We right wingers are easily (1) irked &amp; (2) self-righteousness, casting condemnations like the left does.@BlissTabitha @patfo49 @gtpeople I understand . But, it surprises me when people I highly admire, like Ben Shapiro or Malkin, insult others.@patfo49 @BlissTabitha @gtpeople I understand - a clear misunderstanding. But, I'm shocked by the ad hominems, practiced by us right-wingers@patfo49 @BlissTabitha @gtpeople Even more odd, a pro-lifer attacking a pro-lifer. I wonder if my pro-life friends know Pat White Foster.@patfo49 @BlissTabitha @gtpeople This is the first time ever I've had a pro-lifer insult me with an ad hominem attack. Perhaps he's leftist.@BlissTabitha #RadicalHomosexualTerrorism@BlissTabitha @patfo49 @gtpeople I saw that, but only after I responded.
