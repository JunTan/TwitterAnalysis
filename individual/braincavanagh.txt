You assume the number would level to 1in 4 because of.....?@angrymanwissues let's leave the debate to the people who've been asked. So far from the CA we've seem what that looks like@angrymanwissues I'm trying to point out what rhetoric sounds like but you seem to be missing quite a few points here.@angrymanwissues saves lives because women who wouldn't have had an abortion didn't have an abortion. You sound like John D Walsh@angrymanwissues ..not just ignoring the issue. Let's stick to the topic. Not one prolife non religious group exist. They pushed this law in@angrymanwissues thats rhetoric that means nothing. I could counter with stating that women are going to seek abortions anyway so are...@angrymanwissues because not one prolife non religious group exist. Why?@angrymanwissues so every prolife group in Ireland is religious based. The same ideology the brought the 8th killed those children.@angrymanwissues name one then? Should be easy.@angrymanwissues the same guiding principles and institution brought the law and created tuam@angrymanwissues ....and if you based laws on religion it will have a negative effect@angrymanwissues you can't name one. Odd that isn't it.@angrymanwissues it connects tuam and abortion@angrymanwissues because I can show that the people disseminating the information are based on religious organisations and ideology@angrymanwissues which ones?@angrymanwissues nope, that's not it at all. The 8th should be repealed for some many reasons but the PLC groups represent the church@angrymanwissues this country has Stockholm syndrome with them. Preoccupied? They've raped, murdered and desecrated our people.@angrymanwissues who went on then? PLAC. What road map do you need to see this?@angrymanwissues who goes on the TV,  radio and assembly to support the 8th? The PLC groups. All controlled by Catholic ideology.@angrymanwissues you try to disassociate the church from Tuam and the 8th.@angrymanwissues ..orders took control of social services designed by them@angrymanwissues the 8th was built because religious orders saw international changes in abortion laws. Tuam existed because religious....@angrymanwissues that's not the arguement. The issue is the church's control over people.@angrymanwissues the same ideology that created the 8th is the same ideology that put the children in the ground@angrymanwissues what did she die from?@angrymanwissues ....that rhetoric, I prefer if women had a choice. The church were mandatory in there handling of those women and children@angrymanwissues the lobbyists passed the misinformation to the people.@angrymanwissues because they spread misinformation to the public.@angrymanwissues ...and now we have an option for another referendum.@angrymanwissues you don't see the connection between them. That's either ignorance or being obtuse@angrymanwissues I don't care what you find hard to listen to. I don't want to enslave women and take their children from them@angrymanwissues sinn Fein didn't push this law in. The church did.@angrymanwissues name me a group not connected to the church that supports the 8th@angrymanwissues why are you asking something which has nothing to do with the original post.  You have more of an agenda than us.@angrymanwissues were a Catholic organisation that put kids in the ground. Control and ideology.@angrymanwissues PLAC consisted of 13 catholic organisations led by the Knights of Columbanus. The pushed through the 8th. The Bon Secours..@angrymanwissues @Donal_OKeeffe there is. The church.@angrymanwissues @Donal_OKeeffe there is clearly a connection. PLC and PLAC are the same. They are the church.@angrymanwissues @Donal_OKeeffe if you believe it was democratic why not have another?@angrymanwissues @Donal_OKeeffe PLAC was the group who pushed it, met with leaders and formed all information available.@angrymanwissues @Donal_OKeeffe so your problem is with abortion not with the connection of the church, the 8th and tuam@angrymanwissues @Donal_OKeeffe both are connected.  The same institute and ideas that put them bodies in the ground created the 8th@angrymanwissues @Donal_OKeeffe This one aspect which has very real and obvious connections to the church and the 8th. We can't ignore it.@angrymanwissues @Donal_OKeeffe it doesn't suit me to do anything. I'd rather have those 800 people above ground.@angrymanwissues @Donal_OKeeffe the PLAC were all catholic. The current PLC formed formed from them are all catholic.@angrymanwissues @Donal_OKeeffe it's the same ideology and control in both.

But it suits you more to say something dramatic@MeathRight2Life doctors will not perform past 23 weeks unless the woman's life is in danger. I didn't add an image for that.@MeathRight2Life in a borderline case. That's it. Need for lies or misinformation. Just the truth and people can make up there own minds@MeathRight2Life one example has happened to the contrary in Quebec and is still being investigated. 2 hospitals said no and 1 said yes@MeathRight2Life you slap an image on a vague statement. That's misleading anyone seeking information.@MeathRight2Life Canada only has .86% after 23 weeks and that's only by a doctor in exceptional circumstances.  Like the mother might die@MeathRight2Life attaching the image is an attempt to provoke sentiment. The image has nothing to do with what your saying@MeathRight2Life @thejournal_ie you won't post the image because it's a stock photo. Now you are just deflecting by putting somethig else up@MeathRight2Life I want you too post the link to were that picture comes from because until you do you are just making it up@MeathRight2Life what age is the child?
