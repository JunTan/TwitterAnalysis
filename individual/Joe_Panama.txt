So much of my psychological condition I attribute to that place.@louisemcsharry Yeah, it wasn't until I was detailing it to the Gardaí that I sort of remembered the extent of it fully.@ihwright It was very much the culture when I was there. Students mostly, lots of teachers turning blind eyes to it.that my experience was not the same as people in other schools. Because of my lack of experience I just thought that's what school was likeAnd the kicker for me is I thought this was normal, the culture of violence. It's only after reading that story and consulting with friendsAnyway, there have been people coming out of the woodwork to report their own stories and I hope that gives some solace to other people.@ihwright I'm very very old at heart.@evadiminutive yup@ihwright Did you? I left in '07.I've never known anywhere so violent in the 10 years it's been since I finished school.I'm not without sin either. I was suspended for beating a guy up before, the place is rife with it.Also I'm expecting their loyal lapdogs to come out in support of the school in force.afraid the school will get away with a 'this was a once off and won't happen again' response and that it'll all go away.I hate talking to the Gardaí but there are kids sleeping there tonight who are afraid of where their next beating is coming from and I'mViolence was commonplace there and I've been to the Gardaí to report what I know. I hope others do too. It's a horrible place.I was just reminded of school there. While I was off twitter the story broke about the sexual abuse case in King's Hospital. I went there.@ImSarahCorcoran @bawwby to be fair to them they were horrible because our school was horrible and it brought out the worst in people@ImSarahCorcoran @bawwby Haha they didn't, I was turning them down but let them audition a second time.@bawwby @ImSarahCorcoran to guys thinking (rightly) they had a career in it When they auditioned they didn't sing, just sort of danced at me@bawwby @ImSarahCorcoran that performance was a turning point for them, they went from being guys making weird comments to people at school@bawwby @ImSarahCorcoran here you go now! https://t.co/vsxpQ5l3g8@bawwby @ImSarahCorcoran I actually gave them their '1st gig' (school talent show), there's a Daily Mail UK piece somewhere to prove it!@ImSarahCorcoran @bawwby When I knew them personally they were hideous people, truly slimy.@brian_dneen I wrote it

Until then chew on your knuckles!@griffski going to see it in two weeks from today I think wooConscious too that I no longer have skin in the game so my opinion may mean less exponentially over time but I did spend ten years at it@sweetoblivion26 You're on to something there. That coupled with not being able to survive on your work is what gets us here again I think.@sweetoblivion26 I feel so much boils down to exactly this. I felt the same when I was producing theatre and tv things. We're awful small!@sweetoblivion26 I just think fighting that battle against commercial stations is perhaps the wrong one@sweetoblivion26 I know there was probably more to it than that and you're right people need more exposure to different kinds of irish music@sweetoblivion26 Yeah I get that argument I'm just forever reminded that TXFM went a little off script and wound up out of business@sweetoblivion26 thanks, I've gone a bit ranty now. I might try write a more structured version at some point because it keeps coming up.@brilliantshane that's so shit, small venues in Dublin aren't great but jesus at least we have themRT @ToastFundraiser: Looking forward to getting back in the office and counting up all the awareness we raised.if you start honing your music to be 'more marketable', to sound the way those awful panels want you to we'll all be in a much worse placethis is a great article about why it's important that there is an underground scene for niche audiences https://t.co/ANMoIBq0jJ@karlusss haha okay possibly a terrible example but whoever else then@Stazquatch I would be so down for some vintage westlife!@brilliantshane i'm sure nathan carter would feel the same way about anything I ever wrotethen all of a sudden it's a daft bill. Just because you're not into it doesn't mean it isn't at least as valuable as whatever you're intoanother thing that gets brought up about the broadcasting bill is 'oh well they only want to increase the amount of irish country music'@participantste @PTHosford I think unconventional stations play unconventional music, radio na life, 2xm etc all do a great job of it.@donlothario ffs.. Push into potatoe .. https://t.co/1UZoziGIPb@kobinaireland I guess the point I'm making is that whilst I'm not offering an alternative, this seems like an odd battle to fight.@mormonhorse i need to take more off@kobinaireland you know yourself the reason pop music sounds the way it does is that it's pretty much lab tested to work@kobinaireland and we shouldn't sacrifice that diversity in the name of making chart bangers@kobinaireland i think we're a very diverse artistic nation in proportion to our pop. but our pop makes that diversity difficult to sustain@kobinaireland And I do think the national broadcaster should be required to play indigenous music@kobinaireland I'm not necessarily against quotas I just don't think with a population this small they'll actually help.@bigmonsterlove We may have to chop some of Leitrim, Meath and maybe more.@bigmonsterlove Yeah me too. It doesn't work out on the map like it does in my head but I was trying to keep full counties@LigOFE WE SHOULD MAKE IT MIDDLIER@andgoseek well and truly@amyplify hence rte symphony, concert orcs, lyric fm, arts council grants geared towards classical or educated musicians@amyplify it gets similar funding. similar to other arts strands however public funding tends to serve the interests of the dominant classand the standard of living for musicians who aren't in successful bands is pretty fucking abysmal so I understand why people get upsetThere's a lot more to this discussion and it requires looking at the quality of life for Irish musicians which is a massive, diffuse topic@paulihick yeah that's the prime exampleelitism is a better word than snobbery@brilliantshane well of coursethat people should go somewhere else (listen to something different) could be boiled down to snobbery.Calling bullshit on myself here actually. The point is that places like Coppers ARE good to the huge numbers of peo… https://t.co/E0p3bfQ5a7@Bagga_Cans it definitely can be, all depends on what you're trying to do I guess@Sarklor I built the stage for that haha@Bagga_Cans I think we have quite a proportionately diverse culture I just don't think we have the pop. to sustain it as it is elsewhere@PrayForPatrick touché@participantste @PTHosford this is a simplification I know@participantste @PTHosford I get what you're saying but mainstream pop sounds the way it does because it appeals to a broader audience@PrayForPatrick https://t.co/STj7QKsQlYIf that's the game you want to play thats up to you but it seems like the odds will be forever stacked against you.If you aren't pulling a crowd you mean nothing to them.Get noticed abroad, get a sync on an ad or show, then DJs might start playing your music.@ShapeyFiend Yeah they definitely could do more and that's where I think protest should be directed towards.I don't want to stretch that analogy too far but that's how this works.Coppers will do better than any other nightclub because more people want to go to that kind of place. Better nightclubs have a smaller crowdLook at any other cultural sector in Ireland. The worst places do the most business and they always will. Music is no exception.stations give a shit. 

To them, if it doesn't draw in the biggest crowd, it's not worth playing.Yes it would be great to have a radio platform for Irish music but Irish musicians are kidding themselves if they think the owners of theseThe 'moar irish music on the radio' thing is kicking off again. I always feel really conflicted about this.@Bagga_Cans not really up to clubbin' these days, will meet you for a jar at some point though@deevseverything @jiffington @paperclipton i actually wouldn't know!actually too scared to link my curious cat or even to look at it again or to like one of those 'fav dis and I'll tell you you're deadly'@deevseverything https://t.co/phyYlfgavm@deevseverything I RTd that again because i think it's the best tweet anyone's every done.RT @deevseverything: [cosplaying as Football Man in GAA club] *leans elbow on bar* one pint of crisps please@ApokolipsNow @paulihick hahahaHAI GUYZ FOLLOW MY INSTA https://t.co/24p2VXmZdG@brilliantshane I need to get new curtains?
