Bravo!@SarahPalinUSA What do you mean when you are telling people: now that the health care bill is law to "reload"?Rachel Maddow "Liberal MSNBC Anchor" denies rumours she was asked or that she would run against Scott Brown for Massachusetts senate seat.Article VI, Paragraph 2 of  US Constitution states that federal law is supreme and may not be stopped by state law in any state.US Federal Supremacy laws trump any constitutional challenge to Congress's Health Care Act as proclaimed by Pres. Obama.@metaphorsbwithu I am enjoying our dialogue. We come from very different perspectives.@metaphorsbwithu I expect corruption in politics always, but this plan is much like the one Romney started in Massachusetts.@metaphorsbwithu I don't know about UK but here in Canada there is no health care rationing. Even CDN Conservatives praise our system.@metaphorsbwithu I believe the extension of health care will result in more early diagnosis and disease prevention. That should save lives.@metaphorsbwithu I understand Democrats were pressured to vote for it and Republicans pressured to vote against. What's new there?@metaphorsbwithu There is a challenge of the bill's constitutionality. What is the basis for it? I'm Canadian and have enough to read here.@metaphorsbwithu I like the fact that the health care legislation will insure more than 30 million more Americans and save many lives.Congratulations to the brave Legislators who passed the Health Care bill in the USA. A giant step forward that was long overdue.@calgreg I think that the health insurance bill is a sellout to insurance cos. and not a "government take-over". It is still a step forward.Looking forward to seeing the US Congress pass the Senate Health care bill. It does not go far enough but it is better than doing nothing.@kawarthanews Thanks a lot.

I am not happy with Harper, but dropping charges on Jaffer was by Ontario Government prosecutors not the PM.Hockey player Matt Cooke and Politician Rahim Jaffer are both beneficiaries of lax systems of justice. This is offensive to most Canadians.Unlike torture of Afghan prisoners there's no evidence of Harper Gov't complicity in Jaffer leniency. Prosecutor owes public an explanation.The Harper Government is tough on crime unless it is one of their own.
