THAT'S LIFE.strangers on the street and other public spaces have grabbed my hand, my arm, my ass, my breasts.i saw him moving under the sweater and realized that he and i were the only people on the train. he was staring at me &amp; masturbating.once i was taking the 6 train in NYC, and i saw a man keep spitting into the oversized sweater i was wearing. i was 14 &amp; mostly confused.i've had demeaning comments shouted at me, men honk &amp; whistle at me. men have exposed themselves to me on the street.once upon a time, i didn't think street harassment was a problem either. i believed that it was just a fact of my life.the art fails to distinguish between consensual &amp; nonconsensual behaviors in public spaces &amp; doesnt show that stree‚Ä¶ https://t.co/turPPNvKJyRT @AnnTelnaes: Trump sketch #TrumpPressConference https://t.co/Z46uxiJhF4RT @Snowden: Mr. President, if you grant only one act of clemency as you exit the White House, please: free Chelsea Manning.
