John 3:17God would no longer be good or moral if He let sin go uncondemned.@TheSeverian an unaware, inanimate force could not organize nor order things. Intelligence must be behind order and organization"Is our Christian experience based on our preferences or the revelation of redemption in Jesus Christ?" https://t.co/kY5xarn2Ex@slang4201 that's my point. You know those to be objectively wrong thus objective morals@slang4201 if you agree those things are wrong at all times then you have defined those as objectively wrong,@slang4201 otherwise that means you think it's subjective-Which means there are times when those things are ok.@slang4201 @Morrigan_Roars you also falsely claimed I was ok with rape. Both these imply you agree those are wrong https://t.co/Op7FtDqZko@Morrigan_Roars @slang4201 Canaanite society in OT was totally depraved yet given chance 2 repent. God would b immoral 2 never judge evil@slang4201 @Morrigan_Roars you've said rape, slavery, murder are objectively wrong. Obj morality requires a moral source outside man's mind@slang4201 @Morrigan_Roars you've declared certain things wrong regardless of the society it took place in. That is objective morality.@slang4201 @Morrigan_Roars Moral objections to God must 1st assume objective morality. But w/o God, there is no objective morality.@TheSeverian that energy has no awareness with which to give order.@Morrigan_Roars @slang4201 you presumed I knew nothing. And you tweeted into this ongoing discussion to which I replied@Morrigan_Roars @slang4201 I've not found that to be true at all. The more I study the more I'm aware of our sin to His Holiness@Morrigan_Roars @slang4201 I really wasn't trying to be patronizing. Most people haven't read it for themselves so that's why I asked@Morrigan_Roars @slang4201 have you actually read the bible or just the portions atheists tell you to read?@slang4201 @Morrigan_Roars He gave you free will. Would you rather Him take that away to prove His power to you?@Morrigan_Roars @slang4201 I have freedom &amp; everlasting joy. I hope you discover truth.@slang4201 @Morrigan_Roars recording it happened &amp; approving it r 2 diff things. Bible shows man's sin w/a Just God's mercy@slang4201 @Morrigan_Roars they're not ok in the bible. Not everything done in the bible is condoned by God. most aren't bc man is sinful@Morrigan_Roars @slang4201 watch it bf u dismiss. It explains imp of women 2 God esp in time where secular society didn't value women at all@slang4201 @Morrigan_Roars yet you saying I'm ok with rape and slavery was discussing the issue? Where's your moral stance on lying/slander?@Morrigan_Roars @slang4201 https://t.co/h1G8UhAFrmWe can only say things are immoral if we have an Ultimate Moral Right to judge it against, &amp; that must come from something outside of nature@TheSeverian because of the 2nd law of thermo. Order can't pop out of chaos unless something is there to order it@slang4201 societal norms are ever changing. That is not what we base good/evil on bc there are things we find wrong despite society opinion@slang4201 well that's just a blatant lie@JohnnyDiva that means you do find things objectively wrong. W/o god there's no basis for objective morals, it's just up to man's opinion@slang4201 no, what basis do YOU have to say it's wrong. W/o a god it's left to personal preference, none better or worse than another@TheSeverian if it is not random as you say, from where could it have gotten order if there's no god?@TheSeverian from where did you get your conscience? Random assemblage of particles only gets more particles, not consciences@PascalLeroux evolution would support whatever progressed a species, whether morally right or not. Evolution would make no moral judgment@JohnnyDiva never? Go look at what communism has done to people in the name of atheism@carlossquared @danarel would not always be things that are morally acceptable@carlossquared @danarel evolution/survival would not drive right vs wrong. Evolution would only support what progresses species, which@carlossquared @danarel moral systems do exist in all societies. The question is where would they have come from w/o a god existing@d3vilzadvocate I didn't say the belief in God was necessary for determining good vs evil, but the existence of God is necessary@StevenDLindsey it's a question all people should ask of themselves.@PolarVan but some things are judged evil/wrong whether there is a consequence or not. Things are sometimes judged evil bc of intentions.@danarel the ? is why should anyone listen to how man defines evil bc without a God existing there is no logical standard of right &amp; wrong@slang4201 the problem is that you have nothing by which to define even slavery as evil. So the question is "evil by whose standard?"How do atheists decide something is evil?
