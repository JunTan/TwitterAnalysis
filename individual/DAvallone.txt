Those are good books. That's the best I can do for you. Now settle down and pay attention in class. Bye.@LaresGriton Read "Nixonland" to see where it all starts and what the crucial differences are between the parties, that you miss.@LaresGriton Read "Against All Enemies" by Richard Clarke. Shows how and why it all happened.@LaresGriton They didn't give a shit about Iraq. Bush did. Any book about 2001-2003 will tell you this.@LaresGriton What I found in your timeline was nonsense, regardless of your age.@LaresGriton You're a student. You're not done.

Who does that remind me of?@LaresGriton Did that make sense in your head?@LaresGriton You can't even google-insult well. Writer, not artist. Jesus, you're bad at this.@LaresGriton That you wish you were funny or smart? No. I can follow that.@LaresGriton Enjoy your crow!@LaresGriton Nope. Caps doesn't make something true. Particularly nonsense like that. Bush directed intel to give him the answer he wanted.@LaresGriton Because your argument is far less fresh than you imagine. It was made in 1968 and it was false then. Made in 2000. False then.@LaresGriton Huh. So I have five times the followers because I'm bad at Twitter.

That wasn't me.@LaresGriton Incoherence. Show this thread to a history teacher and let them explain it to you.@LaresGriton But keep appealing to the crowd. Maybe someone will come help.@LaresGriton You don't hurt my feelings. You look stupid. Not cheeky. Not ironic. Just dumb.@LaresGriton Any time you want to stop this all you have to do is stop ranting and get to class.@LaresGriton It's a false premise. There's no use arguing against a false premise.@LaresGriton My profile is my real name and it's public. Not afraid.@LaresGriton You came at me. You can stop this nonsense any time. Harassment isn't when you tweet at people and they respond.@LaresGriton Not a word adults use. Not a word "the Left" uses. Again, sorry. This teaching is taking a lot of time.@LaresGriton I have, actually. Sorry you're not good at this at all.@LaresGriton If you want me to teach you fifty years of American history, you have to pay me and it takes longer than this. Sorry.@LaresGriton If you understood history you wouldn't make the arguments that you do. The answers aren't 140 characters. You don't know them.@LaresGriton You get that the all-caps and the exclamation points have the opposite effect you intend, right?@LaresGriton No likes or RTs. You're not a very good shitposter. Also, literally the saddest thing to admit about yourself.@LaresGriton Btw: quoting me in the hopes that your followers pile on hasn't worked out for you yet. Not even a like? Huh.@LaresGriton Maybe try reading a history book. Good luck in school. It's a little late to start learning.@LaresGriton It would help if you tried to make a little sense. But again: you're a Bernie guy. Reality and complexity aren't for you.@LaresGriton I knew you were a waste of time, but I did get you all rattled, so... some fun there. Have a nice day, kid. Stay irrelevant!@LaresGriton Calling people "loser" when they embarrass you. Now who does that remind me of?@LaresGriton So, a coward. Got it. No courage of your convictions. You need AP History and AP Civics.@LaresGriton Gore would have invaded Iraq? No, kid. He wouldn't have. Humphrey would have bombed Cambodia? No. Read a book.@LaresGriton I'm sure the hundreds of thousands dead in Vietnam and Iraq admire your purity.@LaresGriton I know, kid. That's why I called you a coward. Not an insult: an observation.@LaresGriton This is a parody account, right?@LaresGriton You still haven't proven me wrong: Bernie didn't vote for twenty years. Fact. You're done?@LaresGriton You just keep digging a deeper hole for yourself. I'm so mad, but you have the insults, the all-caps, the exclamation points?@LaresGriton People will find your Twitter account and it will go badly for you. You will say "I was young and stupid" and it won't help.@LaresGriton I don't think it's witty or funny. I think it's very good advice. For you. Someday you'll be an adult looking for a job.@LaresGriton Idiots said that about Nixon and Bush 2. Hundreds of thousands died. That's you and Bernie defined. Worthless.@LaresGriton "i'm literally not a child" says the kid having a giant meltdown. Naptime there?@LaresGriton Yawn. I thought you didn't care what I think? Sure seems like you do. Don't you have a class to get to?@LaresGriton Actually, "delete your account" wasn't invented by Hillary. Goes back much further. World's full of stuff you don't know.@LaresGriton Not mad, little one. Just an adult spanking an idiot child. Which, sorry, you literally are. "Fagboi"? Cuck? Embarrassing.@LaresGriton So you own Donald Trump. You're just that stupid, and care that little about the world.@LaresGriton "Fagboi" isn't how adults talk. Seriously, delete your account.@LaresGriton Do you realize how naive you sound? Her slack campaign beat his by almost four million votes. Embarrassing.@LaresGriton You came at me, little coward.
