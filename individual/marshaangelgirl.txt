The real geniuses simply have their bright ideas closer together.Do not seek to follow in the footsteps of the men of old; seek what they sought.A wise man gets more use from his enemies than a fool from his friends.We are what we repeatedly do; excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.To the man who only has a hammer, everything he encounters begins to look like a nail.https://t.co/kWwxRckncXWhen hungry, eat your rice; when tired, close your eyes. Fools may laugh at me, but wise men will know what I mean.You must be the change you wish to see in the world.Courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the judgement that something else is more important than fear.You miss 100 percent of the shots you never take.The richest man is not he who has the most, but he who needs the least.Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.You can do anything, but not everything.https://t.co/F4qTn3Erz8Can't believe that we share the air with guys like Johnny Deep, thought he was a great person!I got really shocked by the news about Amber Heard against Johnny Deep, OMG how rude! :Ohttps://t.co/jIRmVE2f3Thttps://t.co/VsINM3NjFQI will always remember you Prince!RT @DirectorioModa: voguerunway:
