In fact, the, ahem, ‚Äúmedical establishment" does it often: conducting safety research, etc. 18She also asserts that scis/meds sharing opinions constitutes "gaslighting and paternalistic platitudes". 17In @Guardian piece Grigg-Spall asserts "the medical establishment will twist itself into knots to deny there's a problem with the pill". 16What I don‚Äôt get are accusations hurled against scientists and doctors by people like Holly Grigg-Spall in her piece in the @guardian. 15As to reception of study. Some women who believe HC caused them to be depressed report feeling vindicated; I can understand that feeling. 14Id like to highlight point on exclusion of pregnant/post-partum person-time.

Does that help?@JATetro That is, if someone has a 1 in 1000 chance of a given outcome a factor associated with an HR of 1.5 for that outcome means (cont'd)@JATetro An HR of 1.5 would suggest a 50% increase in the hazards of the outcome, in this case, HIV acquisition.@JATetro No problem!
