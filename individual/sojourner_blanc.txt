But does this exist, free of experience and social standing?@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker But you cannot vouch for the majority of others.@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker That is what has happened, historically.@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker Read MLK's writing on the white moderate.@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker If they are white ppl's idea of humane, then they originate from the experiences of white ppl and may backfire.@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker Can you see that that may be an incredibly privileged belief to have?@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker It's not that your intent would be suspicious; it's your  potential blind spots.@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker *I* am not suspicious. But I know that others would be. And I'm trying to help you see that perspective.@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker It does if it advances a small part of the cause while harming the overall cause. This has been written about.@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker Historically, white-centered initiatives have never properly advanced interests of POC.@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker To be clear: I'm not suspicious. I'm trying to offer you a possible alternative interpretation of your stmts.@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker Given our history, why should they be?@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker If so, it was still their own agenda.@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker The main march was. Satellite marches may or may not have been. Still- led by women of color.@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker Trump would say so.@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker But I believe that was because it was organically supported and organized by women of color.@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker Perhaps I'm just arguing against your standing to dictate the hypo. You can't flunk me. üòâ@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker They already do this with orgs who are willing to center #BLM priorities and leadership. Not just more bodies.@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker I think you are overestimating the ability of this issue to shame or cause adverse action against Trump.@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker I think the assumption is that they have not considered this already and decided that there are other priorities.@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker 140 ltrs is hard. I meant that you *would* be putting yourself in that position if you brought them your priority.@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker Even a witness who's beyond rehab can be preemptively protected by a good OC. You wouldn't believe what I've seen.@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker I understand. I was just gently suggesting that #BLM's own priorities be centered when partnering is considered.@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker Yes, they are.@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker And yes- we have the same wishes. We just differ on pragmatics, I think.@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker I truly do see what you are trying to get at. I just have the opinion that there are factors you are missing.@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker Why would you assume that you know better than #BLM about their proper goals, strategies, and tactics?@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker But then you are in the position of telling #BLM activists that you know better about goals and strategies.@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker You're assuming that there is no opposing counsel to object and reframe.@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker That would be a hostile witness. And you can only ask questions that the judge will sustain. Otherwise-useless.@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker #BLM activists aren't tools to be used. They rightly expect that actions will be focused on their experience.@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker Which will [rightly] not appeal to #BLM@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker Great question. I only request what I know the court will force the witness to do, under pain of jail time.@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker If we do this again with something that will not generate similar numbers, we will squander the effect. 2/@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker We did this with the largest worldwide protests in world history. #womensmarch 1/@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker Sure. But marching for something easily dismissed is &lt; marching for women's rights or minority's rights.@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker Not personally. But enough do that there is plausible dismissibility.@Juris_dudence Sure. But #BLM will see that they are not the priority, and will not largely mobilize.@Juris_dudence I believe the taxes are a separate thing in his mind- not anywhere near his core ego. Which is why he won't care.@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker Reasonable is in the eye of the beholder. Can be easily dismissed. And has been.@Juris_dudence You realize that #BLM is concerned with not being killed 1st. Then economics. Maslow's hierarchy.@Grtseeker @Juris_dudence Then, his domination response will be to claim that they are fake documents- which no one could disprove.@Grtseeker @Juris_dudence And THAT is the real winning strategy here. Leaking will = impotence, and cause a narcissistic meltdown. 1/@Juris_dudence Because it was against him as a person, and his beliefs and ideas. Not against tax documents.@Grtseeker @Juris_dudence Exactly! And if you are already the enemy, then further refusals means beating the enemy.@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker It's a win for him, always. He thrives on domination theater. Further opportunities to refuse = a win for him.@Juris_dudence The people in power who might collaborate know it's an exercise in futility.@Grtseeker @Juris_dudence You cannot force this man to release them. You have a 0% chance of doing so. He can't be impeached for not.@Juris_dudence I believe it is. Congress will not give up their power source, which now is mostly Trump.@Grtseeker @Juris_dudence And how well has that worked so far? Will be blamed on media, and he will not release anyway. Cannot force him.@Juris_dudence I fully get that. My point-it's so small that you cannot mobilize enough people to matter. In fact, will be ridiculed.RT @MuckRock: #FBI documents reveal #Indianapolis Metro Police has owned and operated StingRays since 2012 https://t.co/ObkUaOrN3H cc: @ind‚Ä¶@Juris_dudence @Grtseeker I think the "opportunity" will backfire because of the lack of urgency.

Because for years, there has been no urgent call on their part to organize against police killings.@Juris_dudence But here's the thing. It's not going to work. No standing for suit.
