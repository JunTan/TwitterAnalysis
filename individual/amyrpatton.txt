He can run &amp; scream now.@kourtnikourt What if my culture tells me girls are a financial burden &amp; too many means detriment to my family? Ok to abort then?@kourtnikourt all abortion leads to the same outcome regardless of the reason: a dead child who is genetically unique &amp; will never be again.@kourtnikourt what about the millions who were raised by adoptive parents? Are their lives worthless because their parents were not ready?@kourtnikourt plus he's a boy and I already have a boy. Can't I "terminate" him &amp; try for a girl?? It's my body right?@kourtnikourt but he's 2? Trust me he understands nothing! I could smother him now &amp; he wouldn't know the difference!@kourtnikourt he's a huge stress, inconvenience &amp; taxing on my body. It was much easier when he was in my womb!!!@kourtnikourt back to my toddler who keeps me up all night at times because he has food allergies. But society says I can't kill him. Why?@kourtnikourt that's when u became u! When your father's 23 chroms met your mother's 23. Woop! There's Kourt! never to be duplicated again!@kourtnikourt life is suffering, no doubt. But abortion in society devalues life &amp; promotes the worse kind of violence- mother vs. child :(@kourtnikourt so it's cool to terminate over a million unique lives per yr (USA alone) then?@kourtnikourt not at all. An egg alone does not turn into a human being if left alone. Not will a sperm a lone. So prevention is not same.@kourtnikourt yes. We ate in agreement for .006% of abortions. But most abortions are not because of health but rather lifestyle.@kourtnikourt btw, nice tweeting with you about this. You're thinking. That's always a good thing :)@kourtnikourt "bad"? No. Not bad.@kourtnikourt that's the difference between us: I see a world where the strong protect the weak. Rather than terminate them cause they can.@kourtnikourt phew! Lucky for him. Or you would be lobbying for his destruction.@kourtnikourt kidding of course :)@kourtnikourt the law won't let me ignore him &amp; let him starve while we twitter debate. Can u  start a petition drive for me to legalize it?@kourtnikourt this was fun but I must go. I'm am being forced by the law to feed my toddler (older fetus) even though it's inconvenient :)@kourtnikourt I would refer to a child in the womb as human of course because what else are they? Child is a young human.@kourtnikourt so now feelings are what make someone human? Or valuable? I disagree.@kourtnikourt yes. That's my point. A fetus is just another weak member of the human race who is being killed by a stronger group.@kourtnikourt death camps were also legal in Germany because Jews were not considered human legally either. What side if history are u on?@kourtnikourt but it was legal so ok to kill them right?@kourtnikourt exactly.

Quote from you. Just sayin@kourtnikourt are u aware that only .006% of abortions are to save the life of the mother?@kourtnikourt you just said a fetus isn't human to justify your reasons why it is ok to kill them. I'm just responding to YOUR arguments.@kourtnikourt so it's ok to kill a human because they are younger &amp; not reached an acceptable (to you) stage of development?@kourtnikourt so scientific facts can be changes based on what you feel personally?@kourtnikourt you should ask for a refund of your tuition.@kourtnikourt fetus: "an unborn offspring of a mammal, in particular an unborn human baby more than eight weeks after conception."@kourtnikourt what? Then what is it? Fish? Dog? What are they teaching u? Humans make human off spring?? Seriously.@kourtnikourt you didn't answer my question though. I really want to know why it makes u uncomfortable? I didn't ask what u thought of laws.@kourtnikourt so then you know that abortion ends the life of a living, unique human, correct?@kourtnikourt it does. Many Women suffer emotionally &amp; some physically. It's true. Do you have personal experience with abortion?@kourtnikourt so what should be done about the 44% of women who abort past 8 weeks?@kourtnikourt what happens at 9 weeks that you feel abortion should not be done (besides reasons for maternal health of course)?@kourtnikourt why are you uncomfortable with late term abortion? When are you comfortable with abortion?@kourtnikourt a unique living human being in their smallest form always dies in an abortion. So no, not safe.u were that small once too.RT @MattWalshRadio: Here is my unexpected Four Star Review of Noah: http://t.co/l8THBV9sXPRT @KGWNews: As Oso death toll rises to 18, number of missing drops to 30  http://t.co/UJzyJT2BcA latest on #530slide http://t.co/Yn8XaLdCWn@sweetmayp what is wrong, in your opinion, with using abortion as birth control?@sweetmayp what won't you answer my questions? You are the one who reached out to me, remember? Why?@sweetmayp you really should look at human development &amp; basic biology?@sweetmayp have you taken a human biology class? What is it then if it's not human? Amphibian? Marshian?@sweetmayp 51% of women who had an abortion in 2011 were on birth control. Why are these abortions different than the 49% who were not?@sweetmayp abortion hurts women too, not just the child who's life was taken.@sweetmayp So you too want to restrict it. Why? Why can't anyone have an abortion for any reason?@sweetmayp when it kills another human its a tragedy. what about pedophiles? We don't let them do what they want with their bodies?@sweetmayp how am I forcing people to think abortion is wrong?@amyrpatton: @sweetmayp why do you support abortion...use science to support your position.@sweetmayp sorry but u are like everyone else who loves abortion. You cannot logically support your case. Only insults &amp; poor grammar. #sad@sweetmayp what are we fighting about? You are the one who said "your dumb" and that I ignore science. Insults are not facts or arguments.@sweetmayp and what science am I ignoring?? Science is on the side of prolife! Even proaborts know that!@kourtnikourt http://t.co/V6rpv9BsdY. There are zero restrictions on abortion in OR@sweetmayp and what am I defending?@sweetmayp what are you talking about then? Your tweet said "your dumb" and then u referenced science. your point?

I'm glad you were born :)@Copeiouss and Dems push to end their lives before they begin. Both are morally corrupt.@Copeiouss a place where we don't throw away the weak because the more powerful will it? It would change everything!@Copeiouss I do everything I can to help. Give $ time compassion. Compassion starts w/valuing life as well.@Copeiouss google it. Do your research. Foster system exists because again we don't value vulnerable life in our society.@Copeiouss again, why not just euthanize the poor, the handicapped, the elderly. All those who drain society. Nazis tried that.@Copeiouss 36 couples wait for every 1 baby who is adopted.@Copeiouss a start would be to value life! All life! The poor &amp; vulnerable especially. Then we would be less likely to ignore all injustice@Copeiouss if you ignore injustice then you are a willing participant. History is full of people who ignored slavery or child abuse or ....@Copeiouss should we start euthanizing the poor then? That would solve poverty.@Copeiouss why is it hard?@Copeiouss that's a weak argument. Is it better to kill a child then? We can do better than that.@Copeiouss women need support not abortion. Does having a child ruin a women's life? Can we as a society support working/student moms?@Copeiouss rape is an hideous crime. Do we as a society kill rapists? Should we kill their children?@Copeiouss why sticky? You don't have to be religious to understand that all of us began in the same way &amp; ending life is a grave injustice.@Copeiouss without the right to life all other rights are meaningless.“@sweetmayp: @amyrpatton your dumb” haha!
