That PP is involved in politics? Do you even understand why you're angry? Lmfao.@Katlaya @kelseamcbelsea you're aware the health clinics had nothing to do with the political arms decision, right?@Katlaya then why did you gleefully tweet about PP shutting down?@Katlaya Like, what has PP done to you....@Katlaya Why do you want to see PP shut down so badly?@Katlaya You are. So kindly don't hold me to rules you have created to justify your own hatred and madness.@Katlaya Is there a rule to your idea that they WOULD feel comfortable? No. Of course there isnt. I'm not advocating for shuttering PP@Katlaya I just need help understanding why you want loved and trusted health clinics shuttered...@Katlaya Except, odds are, they won't. Because the private female doctor is often your parents private female doctor.@Katlaya 5) Universal Healthcare does not carry along provisons for increasing medical competency and training providers.@Katlaya AB services are not valuable in the communities where they are offered. The western part of my states ONLY abortion provider is PP@Katlaya 4) PP is often the only provider WILLING to provide abortion care. Just cuz you worked for an AB clinic doesn't mean PP's (2)@Katlaya 3) PP is often the only place teens feel safe asking questions about BC. Private physicians often have relationships with parents@Katlaya 1) PP has organizational values that put unbiased care at the forefront 2) PP leads the pack in training &amp; knowledge w/ transhealth@Katlaya Serious question: Why would a well loved and trusted health care provider suddenly no longer be needed in the advent of free care?@whynotsara Then again, I am the type of Bernie fan who will happily vote for the Dem nominee (and enjoy voting for a woman to boot!)@whynotsara I wouldnt put it past anti's to pretend to support Bernie, with the end goal of turning folks against PP. Twisted folks lol@Katlaya @whynotsara @MattNowak1 Again, maybe get over your arrogance and consider what your ALLIES are trying to explain to you.@whynotsara @Katlaya @MattNowak1 Figured it was worth pointing out, and she launched into assumptions about who I supported and why.@whynotsara @Katlaya @MattNowak1 I spend lots of time around anti-choicers (im a clinic escort) and the "SHUT PP DOWN" thing is their jam.@whynotsara @Katlaya @MattNowak1 She's prob feeling a bit defensive cuz plenty of logical people are questioning the anti-choice rhetoric@Katlaya My points about PP are valid and you refuse to even THINK about what I am saying.@Katlaya I know you are confused but you should prob take a second, breath, and chill with the defensiveness. You're attacking allies.@Katlaya Yes you did. You angrily accused me of supporting a liar. I am a bernie supporter. So... yeah. Logical inference...@Katlaya @whynotsara @MattNowak1 I am a Bernie fan but questioned her attack on PP. Nothing but abuse since. LOL@Katlaya @whynotsara @MattNowak1 Just thought I should let yall know - This pleasant human is attacking fellow Bernie supporters too.@Katlaya Can you help me understand why you are quick to call Bernie a liar while at the same time angrily supporting him online?@Katlaya Why u calling bernie a liar tho?That awkward moment when an abusive jerk accuses you of supporting a liar, and you support Bernie Sanders....  https://t.co/9gfbxGIrHS@Katlaya Are you saying Bernie is a liar?@Katlaya IM A BERNIE SANDERS SUPPORTER!@Katlaya AGAIN - free healthcare for all will NOT solve the issue of biased healthcare, stigmatized healthcare, and ignorance of trans issue@Katlaya Is there a reason you refuse to have a serious discussion about your tweet about PP and decide rather to hurl abuse then block?@Katlaya Hi.

Disregard previous tweet.@wjgreen_ @coolstorysam you two are having quite the jerk off session over shaming me.

You can have it back! :)@coolstorysam @wjgreen_ The good news is this guy is pretty lowball for what I have experienced :) Thanks for the kind words!@wjgreen_ Because THAT's how it happened. #FuckOffNowDouchebagAnd if I had a penny every time a #christian tried evoke fear by bringing up #God. #atheitproblems@wjgreen_ @PPFA Yep.

Yep.@wjgreen_ mmk. Anything else?@wjgreen_ @PPact *yawn* you already said that. anything new or just gonna keep repeating yourself like a typical #antichoice nutbag@wjgreen_ @LiveAction_News @PPFA There is no SHOCKING revelation in a paid actor going into clinics and asking leading questions.@wjgreen_ @LiveAction_News @PPFA LA's previous work just proved to me how ridiculous and biased they were going into this sting.@wjgreen_ @LiveAction_News @PPFA ...I am quite aware of LA's history. But nothing in this sting is about #abortion.@wjgreen_ @PPact I couldnt find a PP that provided abortions when I needed one so I had to pay more for my abortion at a private clinic :(@wjgreen_ @PPact LMFAO at the idea you think it is shocking news that PP provides abortion services. If only more of then did.Fun fact: The folks mad at @PPact over #SexEd sting keep bringing up #abortion. Try an be a BIT less transparent about the obvious bias.@wjgreen_ @PPact Why can't you stay on focus? This video is not about abortion. Abortion is in no way involved in the issue at hand.@wjgreen_ @PPact Example: I can think of dozens of better books to guide newbies than that Fifty Shades crap.@wjgreen_ @PPact I hope PP will use this "sting" to improve its handling of BDSM and other kink questions.@wjgreen_ @PPact Personally, I think PP could have done a MUCH better job instructing on safe BDSM. Thats the biggest scandal here.@wjgreen_ @PPact She was being asked about specific sexual kink. This woman had personal experience. Decided to share.@wjgreen_ @PPact LMFAO. So you are mad that PP provides comprehensive sex ed? Move along.@wjgreen_ Weaker sex? WTF?@wjgreen_ @PPact No qualified counselor will bring personal bias into a health counseling situation.@wjgreen_ @PPact Much like how PP will not shame teens who engage in same sex interactions.@wjgreen_ @PPact Proper response is actually: Is act consensual? Do you like it? Ok. Heres how to do it safely.@wjgreen_ @PPact Why is it so hard for you to understand that your personal morality is not a universal norm?@wjgreen_ @PPact Why? There is nothing wrong with kink. PP is NOT supposed to preach morality.@wjgreen_ P.s. If you are going to tweet someone, have a bit more fight in ya! That was the worst trolling ever! step it up!@wjgreen_ Nothing like confirmation bias!@wjgreen_ Mmk then. Nice talk! P.s. At least you are honest that you already were committed to defunding PP before seeing this video.I'm still curious to find out how @LiveActionFilms would handle a teen asking about specific sex? Fingers in the ears? WE DONT HEAR YOU?@wjgreen_ @PPact Or is there some top secret indoctrination happening where PP seeks out UNWILLING and UNINTERESTED teens to provide info?@wjgreen_ @PPact False. Whats harmful is not answering questions when posed. She asked. PP answered. Get over it.@DJB627 @heatherr_parker Hugs and kisses lovah!@DJB627 @heatherr_parker Yep. Exactly. Why don't you bring up my pluralization fail from yesterday to further illustrate your point :)@wjgreen_ @PPact I did and I'm confused about your outrage.

If you're going to stalk by twitter feed, be a bit more effective.@DJB627 @heatherr_parker not sure why I expected honesty after so much deception. :)@DJB627 @heatherr_parker Let me guess: You decided to make this "age-restriction" not to protect anyone, rather to be dramatic.@DJB627 @heatherr_parker P.s. by "age-restricted" you mean "Click a box". LOL. Hardly restricting access to minors there...@DJB627 @heatherr_parker Then perhaps refrain from using the word "unedited" as that is clearly not true. It is edited. Plenty.@RachelLarris I DO have plans to visit the National Zoo for an hour or so before heading back down south (Loves me some zoo!)@RachelLarris I don't think I will have MUCH time for play.

Just not deceptively so.@heatherr_parker @LiveActionFilms Why am I NOT surprised. I was shocked to see that the "unedited" footage was indeed edited... #SexEdNext in #SexEd video: extensive discussion about safer sex practices and condom use. #ProChoice #LiveActionIn #SexEd video: PP starts conversation with intimate partner violence questions. When girl says "No" they follow up with take-home info.So much deception in #SexEd film. It boggles the mind. How does @LiveActionFilms get away with this shit? Open your eyes people!Lots of #antichoice folks were crying about @PPact not protecting this teen girl from DV. All this was edited out of shareable video.This is how @LiveActionFilms works folks: Present a deceptively edited film and make it easy to share. Put extra steps in for Full footageCurrently watching the "longer" "unedited" cut of @LiveActionFilms most recent youtube video. Wow. Lots of deceptive editing.@lynjfry Well.

I support realistic education.@lynjfry You can be an idealist all you want and all it takes is for a partner to stray ONCE.@lynjfry Also, #abstience programs perpetuate ideals vs. reality. Women who wait until marriage are STILL at risk for STI's@lynjfry We just don't ignore that despite this info, people will do it anyway.@lynjfry Nope. Which is why Comprehensive sex ed addresses abstinence and monogamy.@lynjfry And, while age of onset may be delayed with #abstinence ed, risk of STI or pregnancy is SIGNIFICANTLY higher with this group.@lynjfry Our brand of sex ED has actually reduced STI infection rates, teen pregnancy rates, AND decreased # of partners.@lynjfry Norms have changed as well. Girls used to get hitched while high school aged. Nothing has changed in society. Teens always teens.@lynjfry Society just used to do an EXCELLENT job of hiding it.@lynjfry Actually, for as long as puberty aged teens have hung out together substance abuse and sex have been happening.@lynjfry We explain what alcohol poisoning is. We discuss the issue of sex while drunk, consent, and liability.@lynjfry And no. We didn't use scare tactics. We discussed laws, what happens if you violate laws, and how alcohol works in the body.@lynjfry Well look at who is making assumptions now? :)@lynjfry Meanwhile, look at the economic and personal impact of car accidents.@lynjfry The only time an STI infection becomes an issue is if untreated, which is rare with current knowledge.@lynjfry The majority of transmitted infections are 100% treatable.@lynjfry And many STI infections are as serious as a nasal infection. STI's do not ruin your life. Nor do they cost thousands to treat.@lynjfry It would be great if you could just be HONEST about why you support abstinence ed. You JUST proved it isnt JUST about health.@lynjfry And that meaning is often based in personal morality. Bam. Thanks for proving my point.@lynjfry Could you explain what exactly you know about comprehensive sex ed. It doesn't seem as if you are familiar with what happens.@lynjfry And guess what: Comprehensive sex ed talks about the emotional impact as well. :)@lynjfry Men have oxytocin too. Perhaps you are referring to societal norms more and biological facts less?@lynjfry Do you have any evidence that proves women are biologically more prone to emotional consequences from sex?@lynjfry The fact that sex, something 99% of the human population will do (often before 20 years old) is something that should be included.@lynjfry This is why we teach tooth brushing and hand washing in public schools. This is why we teach drivers ed in public schools.@lynjfry It doesn't. Zero evidence supports the claim that it helps. What DOES help is giving folks fact based health info.@lynjfry Heres the deal: You can teach your kids what you want. Just don't expect me to buy the b.s. line that abstinence education HELPS.@lynjfry When you shame sex, sex becomes shameful.@lynjfry Abstinence education only serves to shame and stigmatize those who are sexually active, pushing them into riskier behavior.@lynjfry I can't tell you how many of the college kids I sex educated had received abstinence education and were obviously having sex.@lynjfry This is NOTHING new. The teenage brain craves risky behavior. Often to their own detriment.@lynjfry Except it really isn't. Middle school aged children drink (often to dangerous levels). They do drugs. They have sex.@lynjfry And avoided preaching morality i.e. DOnt Drink.@lynjfry Actually the program was for incoming freshmen (so not legal drinkers) and many were not already drinkers. We gave EVERYONE info.@lynjfry nice dodge of my point about driving. Don't lie and say you promote abstinence out of public health concern. If you drive, thats BS@lynjfry And what sort of education did you recieve about sex and drugs as a teenager? Did someone tell you to abstain?if you claim you believe in #abstinence education because of public health, you BEST not be driving a car EVER. #abstainfromdriving@lynjfry Hell. Ignoring the risk to self, driving puts so many others at risk.@lynjfry If you are TRULY concerned about public health, and view abstinence as all that is needed, you wouldn't be driving. period.@lynjfry Not just driving as teens. Driving as an adult is one of the riskiest health behaviors one can engage in. Seriously. Look it up.@lynjfry Not assuming... Using your words to draw inferences. Perhaps use different words if I am misunderstanding you.@lynjfry So far, the only area you seem to promote abstinence in is an area that involves some morality judgement.@lynjfry So again, you promote abstinence from public spaces correct? And abstinence from driving or public transit?@lynjfry I assure you YOUR teens may not be able to handle sex. Plenty of teens ARE. Again, think outside of your self and your family.@lynjfry Anything to back up your claim that teenagers lack the development needed to understand sex and sexual health?@lynjfry We were actually fixing the damage done by abstinence based programs.@lynjfry Have you ever sat through a comprehensive sex ed program? I taught #SexEd at the college level. We weren't walking anyone into sex.@lynjfry Our safe drinking program resulted in a shocking decrease in minors arrested for alcohol offenses on campus.@lynjfry We educated on drugs, alcohol, sex, relationship issues, and nutrition. Our unbiased, open, honest approach improved health outcome@lynjfry Drinking abstinence programs fail as well. I was deeply involved in successful peer health education initiatives in college.@lynjfry Since when is it acceptable to pretend shit doesn't exist and hope it disappears?@lynjfry And why is that wrong? If teens have questions about sexual expression they deserve honest answers.@lynjfry Fun fact: Preaching abstinence against drugs doesn't work very well either. DARE programs are resounding failures.@lynjfry Do you teach abstinence from public spaces, where the liklihood for bacterial or viral infection is high?@lynjfry So again, in what other areas do you teach abstinence? Will you teach your children to abstain from driving (riskier than sex)@lynjfry Why force this moral world view on society at large?@lynjfry Youve taken the steps you needed to take to make sure your children are not exposed to comprehensive sexuality education.@lynjfry And confused as to why someone, who has this control, wishes to legislate what is available to other children.@lynjfry Now you are the one assuming. Never said your kids dont have freedom. Just pointing out how easy it is to control what kids hear.@lynjfry Please quit acting as if you didn't mean something simply because you don't explicitly say it.@lynjfry When I talk to people, I examine what they say as well as the context of their beliefs. It's called critical thinking.@lynjfry You are suggesting Christian morality be taught to all. That is conflating Church and State. I am using the power of inference.@lynjfry What will you do if one of your children decides to have sex, despite your abstinence education. Just hope for the best?@lynjfry Also, I know you are preaching morality as I see no signs of you preaching abstinence with other public health issues.@lynjfry And thus you have made sure your children are exposed to what you want them exposed to. See how parenting choice works?@lynjfry Comprehensive sex ed is ALL inclusive. Caters to the needs of those who wish to abstain or delay as well as those who are active.@lynjfry This is actually VITAL info for married couples as well, Esp. concerns about consent, as rape can and DOES happen in marriage.@lynjfry The only difference is we dont stop there. We discuss what to do if you decide to have sex. How to protect yourself.@lynjfry Fact is EVERY comprehensive sex education program in existance discusses abstinence. 1st thing i'd discuss when teaching sexed@lynjfry Preaching abstinence only is 100% preaching morality and ignoring reality.@lynjfry Further... you home school. You obviously have figured out how to protect your children from comprehensive education.@lynjfry And again, why is it you are opposed to the separation of church and state? Slippery slope you are on.@lynjfry Would you still support preaching morality if your specific type of morality wasn't the norm?@lynjfry I'm also curious why you think it is acceptable to preach morality rather than educate with fact based health info?@lynjfry Hell, do you drive? Driving puts your health and life in FAR more risk than the most promiscuous of the promiscuous.@lynjfry You are preaching morality, not public safety. Don't get it twisted.@lynjfry Hell, lets all stay in our homes and never go outside. Abolish public schools. Infections are BAD and must be avoided by abstinence@lynjfry Define Promiscuity then. Why not admit you wish to bring church into the dealings of the state? Why so opposed to my freedom?@lynjfry Because its unrealistic. I'd rather educate for what will REALLY happen as opposed to what my ideals are...So excited to see #SexEd supporters dominating the twitter conversation about #SexEd. Nice try @LiveActionFilms@lynjfry IS there a reason you expect society at large to live life by your own PERSONAL standards?@lynjfry I prefer to live in a world where people have the education needed to protect themselves.
