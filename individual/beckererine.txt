Hope you're getting a cozy, calm day at home.... And my heart is heavy today but also thankful for a twitter community that's helped give me the confidence to begin to do this....So I will be doing my best to educate myself, educate others in situations where it's safe, listen, &amp; relay truth to bigotry. ...&amp; I wonder how many with white/christian privilege have, like me, stayed silent &amp; cowardly at family gatherings, parties, etc? ...... And today I'm reflecting on how it's been 15 yrs since 9/11 and so many have reported this bigotry getting worse. ......And maybe my comment would have made a difference. And maybe not. But I should have said something. I should have used my privilege. ......Guess no one told their husbands they were supposed to keep them at home. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ......Have you talked to your Muslim women friends about this? Because mine are a doc, a lawyer, a professor, a marketer, &amp; an analyst...(**TW islamophobia.**) A family friend implied Muslim woman were often forced to stay at home. And I simply could have said...Today I'm thinking of how just the simplest response to some nonsense yesterday could have made a difference......Thinking about this today especially knowing how Islamophobia has affected the lives of so many dear friends since 2001. ......&amp; then I self-censor. And lose the opportunity to use my privilege to maybe plant a seed, give a new perspective, etc. &amp; we move on. ......or "what if I offend this person" (usually parent of a friend/older friend of family) and cause a stir/hurt their feelings...Then come the excuses. Usually here (in Chile) it's "I don't want to be the American who goes around telling people they're wrong"...... &amp;suddenly heart's pounding, face flushing, &amp; i'm thinking: this is so wrong. I have to say something. &amp;begin to strategize in my head...... So often conversations that are fine one minute veer into bigotry. It ALWAYS catches me off guard, though it shouldn't. ...I really struggle with when to speak up/call out IRL. And the next day it's like a hangover, rehashing the problematic convo in my head...@Monica_BW so cute!! and cooking very healthy from the looks of it.

Now Simon Snow is reminding me of that.But by the time HP #5 came out, I thought I was too cool for "kid books." Took until my mid-twenties to realize how wrong I was!This book is igniting some feelings in me that have been dormant since finishing HP #4.

Everything was forced into those boxes…More thoughts to come. Just needed to start exploring this. Something I’m thinking about every day.It’s really sad that I can claim my culture so freely, even be respected for it––while so many others have to worry, assimilate, hide.People talk poorly about “immigrants” in front of me. They forget I AM an immigrant. White + US passport = “expat.” Something fancy, good.I mean, I even dyed my hair blonder. That’s the kind of choice everyone should get. Hair color. Hijab. Turban. Yarmulke. Whatever.I can’t imagine feeling like I couldn’t speak my own language in public. Or worrying about what to wear, the color of my skin, hair.Still, it’s hard living in a foreign country. I can’t imagine doing it while facing discrimination. Or as a refugee, forced to leave my own.Even in a foreign country, I carry my privilege with me. Once I saw “gringo go home” on a wall in Valparaíso. ONCE. In 3 yrs, that’s it.But I don’t have to worry. No one gives me a hard time. I learned Spanish, speak with a Chilean accent. But no one asked me to “assimilate.”I recently moved back to Chile. I am a foreigner here. I speak English in public. Wear my US-purchased clothes.
