20/20Let‚Äôs use that voice. What future do you stand for?

It‚Äôs easy to get discouraged &amp; want to give up, thinking it won't change. 17/HRC is all of us: Smart women who work hard being called ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù and getting talked over by loud, incompetent bullies. 16/It betrays the deeper undercurrent of what all women come up against every day. 15/So this is why, every time people say ‚Äúshe‚Äôs not a perfect candidate‚Äù ‚Äî even if it‚Äôs part of a case for voting FOR HRC ‚Äî it hurts me. 14/Look at all the antics DJT is getting away with right NOW! 13/For a man these ‚Äúscandals‚Äù would be non-issues.

Just wow. 9/HRC is a woman who is arguably more experienced, prepared, qualified, and dedicated than any man has ever been for this job. 8/It is RIDICULOUS that THIS man has the same amount of time in the spotlight, the same weight in the polls, the same voice in the press. 7/The way we tend to automatically ascribe authority to men (esp. rich white men) is astounding if you use this lens to look at DJT v. HRC. 6/Someone at some point has probably talked about this (re: the campaign).
