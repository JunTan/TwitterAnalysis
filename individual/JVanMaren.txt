I'm sure your biases will serve you well.@ruben_timmerman Well, since you've firmly entrenched yourself in ideology and insist on your racial view of everything, I suppose that's it@ruben_timmerman Depends where you are. I've certainly heard many complains about them taking jobs, by many who have lost jobs.@ruben_timmerman I suggest you do more research before condemning half the population as racists and ignoring their concerns.@ruben_timmerman In the Netherlands they complain about Eastern European migrants in precisely the same way for the same reasons.@ruben_timmerman Well, He was pretty clear on obeying the law. So I think we know.@ruben_timmerman ...demanding lawlessness and the accepting of lawlessness is ludicrous.@ruben_timmerman Nations have the right to demand a process for immigration. We might have a variety of views on what they are, but...@ruben_timmerman No, because they entered a country illegally. The same reason you need ID to cross the border. Again, you're blowing smoke.@ruben_timmerman Again, it's racializing something to hype the debate and allow accusations of racism to overcome the policy discussion.@ruben_timmerman And that should be addressed. But "deporting Mexicans" and "deporting illegal immigrants" is much different.@ruben_timmerman That's because they do what they accuse us of: ignoring what real people are experiencing, generalizing, labeling.@ruben_timmerman and those of us who have researched Black Lives Matter disagree for very specific reasons: https://t.co/ZKssC4BizY@ruben_timmerman Deportation of those in the US illegally does not equal wanting to "deport Mexicans." At all.@ruben_timmerman Unless, of course, you happen to be a Christian business owner targeted for shutdown by the LGBTQ lobby. But ignore them.@ruben_timmerman This is precisely the sort of tribal thinking that just doesn't make sense to most people.@ruben_timmerman Don't buy what? The fact that white progressives want to marginalize and sideline Christians, even if they're white?@ruben_timmerman As for the /alt-right/, they are reprehensible and I've written multiple columns on why.@ruben_timmerman Russell Moore of the Southern Baptist Convention has written eloquently on racial reconciliation.@ruben_timmerman There are churches of every background who have been targeted, and it's because of their beliefs.

I just think he's a product of porn culture.@DrDavidLey @JessicaValenti fair enough. But the question is simple: do u condemn porn that calls women the c-word or whores?

Also, conservatives are not acting like Him and should be ashamed of themselves.Liberal contradiction #5: There are no inherently feminine or masculine traits. Also, we will use those traits to justify transgenderism.Liberal contradiction #4: Your brain is the result of series of cosmic evolutionary accidents. Also you should have complete faith in reasonLiberal contradiction #3: Sexual orientation is fixed and immovable. Also, people can be bi and gender is completely fluid.Liberal contradiction #2: Campus men are all potential rapists.

It's very clear...um...PICK ME. --@JustinTrudeau  #MunkDebateTrudeau's trying to remember his lines. You know he doesn't remember when he doesn't interrupt. #MunkDebateWorld War II is Justin Trudeau's favorite war because he doesn't have to decide whether or not to bomb anyone. #MunkDebateFun fact: When the opposition leaders talk about "our deal" with different countries, those deals are not in "their deals." #MunkDebateRT @stephen_taylor: Mulcair: "Mr. Trudeau doesn't like debates because he's used to having his lines written for him"RT @sunlorrie: Mulcair on Trudeau: "He's not used to debates because he's used to having others write his lines for him."RT @InklessPW: Bulk water exports!

Just to be clear. #MunkDebateWho told @JustinTrudeau that he's not allowed to be quiet, ever? #MunkDebate@JustinTrudeau says that the whole world looks down on Canada so much I think he's starting to believe it #MunkDebateI'm sure Harper likes that this part is in French. Most of Canada ignores this part. #MunkDebateIf you want to fight global warming, okay. But selling the idea that it'll help the economy is a stretch. We're not stupid. #MunkDebateRT @JJ_McCullough: I don’t understand why left-wing politicians always say the economy and environment go hand-in-hand.

Huh. #MunkDebate@pmharper is having fun now. He's schooling Mulcair. #MunkDebateRT @stephen_taylor: Mulcair thinks the audience is stupid.

Refineries would take 30 years to build and would cost $30 billion.RT @AndrewLawton: Harper calling out Mulcair’s lack of understanding on how trade works. Effectively, at that. #MunkDebates@JustinTrudeau: "I will build bridges with leaders through a careful strategy of interrupting all the time." #MunkDebateAfter his long campaign as a conservative, @ThomasMulcair is probably relieved at the chance to side with progressives #MunkDebateDoes @JustinTrudeau remember what his dad did to Canada's standing with the US and beyond? Gutting the military? Etc? #MunkDebate@JustinTrudeau--We will continue Mr. Harper's policy!--That must have hurt. #MunkDebateAnd Mulcair gets his laugh! A bit cheap, though. No one can imagine Trudeau and Putin facing off. #MunkDebate@JustinTrudeau tries to look fierce. Somewhere, Putin cackles loudly. #MunkDebateHarper is nailing this one. He called Putin a long time ago. #MunkDebateRT @stephen_taylor: Moderator: "Mr. Trudeau, how will you deal with Putin?"

Audience: "LOL"The idea of @JustinTrudeau dealing with Putin actually gets a laugh...#MunkDebateRT @AndrewLawton: And Harper slips in a tax aside in the foreign policy debate! #MunkDebateA Trudeau growing a pair on the military...that's a new one. #MunkDebateRT @AndrewLawton: This debate proves why non-consortium debates can be amazing. Kudos to #MunkDebate organizers and Rudyard. Best one thus …I notice @JustinTrudeau and @ThomasMulcair haven't mentioned Putin's Middle East deal against ISIS yet...#MunkDebateRT @AndrewLawton: Speaking of abortion, a star Liberal candidate managed to elude the pro-life candidate ban. #MunkDebate http://t.co/5kp6F…Sigh. HARPER HATES SCIENCE! Does anyone else get tired of that? #MunkDebateTrudeau and Mulcair become suddenly very much in favor when it comes to decapitating--as long as its children in the womb #MunkDebateThe solution to ISIS? Not fighting ISIS. Providing abortions for ISIS rape victims. That's @ThomasMulcair &amp; @JustinTrudeau #MunkDebateSo when Harper remains nonpolitical on abortion while Trudeau advocates it, Harper is the one who is "prisoner of ideology"? #MunkDebateThe irony is sickening. Trudeau pitches abortion while claiming concern for the "most vulnerable" #MunkDebateOh boy. Here we go. More abortions, always more abortions with @JustinTrudeau #MunkDebateFirst @ThomasMulcair compliments Thatcher, then Cameron. If only Harper were British. #MunkDebateRT @AndrewLawton: When Harper and Trudeau are speaking at the same time, how am I to know who the audience is applauding?! #MunkDebateRT @InklessPW: LOUD NOISESSomeone tell Pierre's kid to wait his turn.

Credit where credit is due, with the exception for rig…Oh come on. Talk about the politics of fear. First Nations groups and environmentalists? #MunkDebateI think @JustinTrudeau just said we should be discussing the economy rather than foreign policy...#MunkDebateI think it's indicative that the NDP thinks global warming is more important than the slaughter of Christians overseas. #MunkDebateDo the opposition leaders really think Canada has become such a hellscape under the Conservatives? #MunkDebateMulcair is now brainstorming how to get a laugh, too. #MunkDebateOh good, Trudeau is willing to admit that CPC isn't creating a police state. #MunkDebate Baby steps, people.I wonder how the West is responding to the Pierre hagiography #MunkDebateHarper must love watching Trudeau defend parts of C51. #MunkDebateAhh, the politics of fear. I wonder if we should be afraid of ISIS? #MunkDebate"It's not true"--Mulcair steals Trudeau's favorite line #MunkDebateWhy won't @JustinTrudeau every stop interrupting? #MunkDebateDo none of the opposition leaders realize that the debate might be about what Canadian values ARE? #MunkDebateDoes @JustinTrudeau wanna bring up Pierre's response to terrorism? Soldiers..with guns..in our cities..#MunkDebateOhh we did Layton now we're doing Pierre. It's like a prance down memory lane. #MunkDebateIt's always fun watching Mulcair try to decide which facial expression to wear. Four within a minute now. #MunkDebateTrudeau and Mulcair won't stop ISIS filling body bags, but they'll defend your right to wear one at a citizenship ceremony #MunkDebateMulcair is probably salivating right now..#MunkDebateSo, Liberals, how did we do bringing Jews in during WW2? #MunkDebateRT @JJ_McCullough: This new translator sounds like someone making fun of Trudeau.I'm thinking security screenings under @ThomasMulcair &amp; @JustinTrudeau would be hard if no one had to show their faces...#MunkDebateThe translator sounds like someone reading a audiobook classic #MunkDebateOhh it wasn't about politics a minute ago. Now it's about "political will." #MunkDebateI'd honestly like to hear what @JustinTrudeau and @ThomasMulcair think is adequate for security screening #MunkDebateNext up: @ThomasMulcair announces his plan to allow incoming refugees to keep their niqabs on during security screenings. #MunkDebateAnyone wanna ask whether or not there's any difference between the Irish in the 1800s and the Syrians now? Anyone? #MunkDebateCanada under Harper: We now hate human beings and diversity--@JustinTrudeau. What? Does anyone take this guy seriously? #MunkDebate@JustinTrudeau "This is not about politics" lol #MunkDebate@JustinTrudeau tries to wax eloquent about the Irish while also remember everything he's supposed to say while looking serious #MunkDebateNext up: @ThomasMulcair and @JustinTrudeau advocate for firefighters to only rescue victims while not fighting fires #MunkDebateRT @AndrewLawton: I can’t wait until Trudeau announces pick for “Canadian Ambassador to ISIS.” You know, because savages like diplomacy. #M…@JustinTrudeau and @ThomasMulcair seem to worry far more about past crises so as to avoid talking about the current one #MunkDebate@ThomasMulcair is more worried about Harper saying "mosque" than slaughtered Christians in the Middle East #MunkDebate"Attack root causes," @JustinTrudeau?

Since when did Canada give up peacekeeping? @JustinTrudeau thinks we can keep the peace where there is no peace to keep #MunkDebateReminding us about the 2003 Iraq invasion while asking us to support by teaching others is classic @JustinTrudeau #MunkDebate@ThomasMulcair wants to hit Harper over falling out with the White House by...pulling us out of a coalition with the US? #MunkDebateDoes @ThomasMulcair think the Amish and Evangelicals have been launching an insurgency that requires his attention? #MunkDebate@ThomasMulcair ...can you think of anywhere that the UN moved too slowly? Rwanda? #MunkDebateYes.
