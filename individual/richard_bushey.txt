He's nothing but a rhetorician trying to smear his opponentsI cannot stand that several times Shabir Ally accused David Wood (@Acts17) of being happy that ISIS slaughtered people. Very disingenuous.It must be nice to not care about representing your opponents properly. The rest of us are burdened with careful research/thought/listening.David Wood (@Acts17) knows everything about Islam. He did great in his recent debates against the worlds greatest Islamic apologist.It is really interesting how much overlap there is in the presentations of textual criticism in @DrOakley1689's and @BartEhrman's books.Somebody wrote, "The times smell of sunset." Smelling sunsets? What a strange metaphor. He could've said "the proverbial sun is setting."People in the south are far too polite.In his debate with William Lane Craig, Bart Ehrman totally ignored the probability calculus - Craig's central objection to Ehrman's argumentPeople say "I feel..." as a substitute for "I think..." I wonder if this is a symptom of an emphasis on emotion as final arbiter of truth.In 200 years, people will reflect upon the functionality of today's internet, saying, "They had to wait for pages to load."It is interesting how sometimes I have time write an article, but do not have a topic, and at other times, I have several topics and no timeAn undergraduate said, "Dan Wallace seems to be theologically orthodox."

Ecstatically exciting.@colasante I just found this.

With their upcoming schedule (eagles/dolphins), they could be 4-0 in a few weeks.Because every Christian on his page gets blocked! He clearly just wants to throw red meat to his Muslim audience.Even though Ahmad's page is titled "Calling Christians" I am becoming suspicious that it is intended only for Muslims.If Ahmed cannot handle disagreements, he should not be a polemicist and have a page criticizing Christianity.There have been too many times where I respectfully disagreed with Ijaz Ahmed and he just deletes my comment and accuses me of spam.The Jets have forced a total of 10 turnovers in 2 games. In the 2014 season, they forced a total of 13 turnovers in 16 games.Just as everyone expected, Andrew Luck and the Colts are 0-2, losing to the Bills and the Jets.@colasante My father thinks Fitzpatrick is targeting Marshall in triple coverage because he complains in the huddle.@colasante are you watching the game?@FaS_Skeptic Actually the Roman Catholic doctrine is that when he is speaking ex cathedra, he is infallible. But he errs in normal life.@colasante Do you like the 20 yards = 1 point rule?

You may already know that.@DellaTorre9 @SomecallmeNay You have a very eloquent way of changing the subject. I can see how people get frustrated with you.@DellaTorre9 @SomecallmeNay That is not love. That is conception of love is... offensive to ethics. You are right.@DellaTorre9 @SomecallmeNay But you are just sort of using the word 'love' as a broad brush that could be used to describe any behavior.@DellaTorre9 @SomecallmeNay Ethics flow from love.@DellaTorre9 @SomecallmeNay But there are certain precepts within love. Be kind. Do not be jealous. These are ethics.@DellaTorre9 @SomecallmeNay While love will manifest differently, we can certainly agree some things are once-and-for-all ethically wrong.@DellaTorre9 @SomecallmeNay Everybody thinks that they are being loving. The word 'love' is used as a guise what is truly hate.@DellaTorre9 @SomecallmeNay The question is what love means. The Westboro Baptist Church says that they are exhibiting love.@DellaTorre9 @SomecallmeNay Your original tweet was that there was not a once and for all ethical standard. But 'love' is that standard.@SomecallmeNay @DellaTorre9 People have different conceptions of what it means to love.@SomecallmeNay @DellaTorre9 So it is possible to be more specific. The broad brush of "just love," while a good overview, is not enough.@SomecallmeNay @DellaTorre9 For example in 1 Corinthians 13, we learn that love is not jealous. It is kind. And so on.@SomecallmeNay @DellaTorre9 It would be a mistake to broadly say "just love." While that is true, it is too open to interpretation.@SomecallmeNay @DellaTorre9 You are using the word 'love' in a very generic way so that I do not really know what you are talking about.@SomecallmeNay @DellaTorre9  What you specifically said was, "obeys no morality and gives birth to no morality." The implications are clear.@DellaTorre9 @SomecallmeNay If you say things like, "love obeys no morality," then you are saying that this commandment needn't obedience.@DellaTorre9 @SomecallmeNay I did not suggest that. I just said that it is a once and for all standard that we should be concerned with.@DellaTorre9 @SomecallmeNay If you suggest that you are not concerned with morality, then you are not concerned with that commandment.@DellaTorre9 @SomecallmeNay That is a once-and-for-all ethical standard.@DellaTorre9 Okay, but your original claim was a "once and for all" ethical standard is absurd. But the existence of sin presupposes that.@DellaTorre9 That line assumes that sin exists. The existence of sin assumes that there are moral precepts.@DellaTorre9 there is more than one word in the bible. it is strange to use 'agape' as an excuse for living an evil life.You're not prying open a crate that says 'explosives' with a pickaxe, Kate.@DellaTorre9 We wouldn't be able to just say "ah well it's all too abstract anyway so I might as well be evil."@DellaTorre9 But there is a universal standard of right and wrong. So it doesn't matter how it usually conceived.There comes a point where every exegete must hand the reins over to the philosophical theologian.@DellaTorre9 Okay, so the gospel does not "undo ethics altogether," and the Christian should be "interested in morality."@DellaTorre9 The amount of times that you repeat this enforces the fact that it is not really working.@DellaTorre9 Well again, all I see you saying is that you prefer to live an evil life without fear of judgment.@DellaTorre9 this is what I read when you say that: "the idea of my living by an ethical standard is becoming more absurd every day."@jstuart197 @ScientiaPercept @SemiMooch @apologist215 Well he was trying to represent presuppositional apologetics but he didn't know how.Life is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.Out, out, brief candle!

It's only denied based on agenda.@sinatheist666 @ScientiaPercept like I said, I am not interested in debating it. Also the certainty I have is parallel to that of historians@sinatheist666 @ScientiaPercept which is exactly what the young earth creationists do. You're sort of the YEC of the disciple of history.@sinatheist666 @ScientiaPercept I am not interested. You have a bunch of canned answers in response to the secular historians data.@sinatheist666 @ScientiaPercept it's a shame that all of the secular scholars were duped.@ScientiaPercept I think I'd like a "did Jesus exist?" debate.@ScientiaPercept hey, how's it going? Are you interested in another debate sometime?@CounterApologis by the way, where did you see my article? Who shared it?I just went to a store in which the attendant spoke only Spanish. Very unusual.@CounterApologis However I do plan to link to Dan's article an the ensuing conversation in the bottom of the one that you saw.@CounterApologis Mine was not actually a response to his. I was thinking of making it one but I decided to make it more general.@CounterApologis But what do you mean by a "brute moral ought."?@CounterApologis Dan Linford already wrote a 9 page response. Let me deal with that first!@CounterApologis I am scrolling your timeline. Everything you say is about religion. We have the same hobby. Just different perspectives.@VaporPete @Christ_is_LORD @cooperlewis_ @Nathan011 They can be. It depends on who is using them.@CounterApologis Lol, well it is for school. Also that statement was a little tongue in cheek.@ElijiahT People are still talking about this?@FaS_Skeptic it's not secular anymore. I just prayed for blessings over your run. Take that, atheist.@cooperlewis_ @Christ_is_LORD It is not an appeal to an explanation. That is a fundamental misunderstanding. A strawman.@cooperlewis_ @Christ_is_LORD But the argument is *deductive.* Meaning that it flows from a set of premises to a conclusion.@cooperlewis_ @Christ_is_LORD That is a caricature of the argument. You are assuming that God is being used as an explanatory hypothesis.@Nathan011 @Christ_is_LORD @cooperlewis_ The type of slavery to which you refer is always wrong. But you're equivocating.@Nathan011 @Christ_is_LORD @cooperlewis_ Then you don't care that you're equivocating. That is totally self-serving and unmoving.@Nathan011 @Christ_is_LORD @cooperlewis_ but you don't care. You're only interested in what serves your argument.@Nathan011 @Christ_is_LORD @cooperlewis_ Exodus 21:16 univocally forbids all kidnapping. No caveats.@Nathan011 @Christ_is_LORD @cooperlewis_ You have no interest in the historical context. You're totally self serving.@Nathan011 @Christ_is_LORD @cooperlewis_ but the only reason you think that is that you're looking for reasons to be offended.@Nathan011 @Christ_is_LORD @cooperlewis_ but that's not how we have open and honest discussions.@Nathan011 @Christ_is_LORD @cooperlewis_ based on your bias and how you'd like to frame your argument.@Nathan011 @Christ_is_LORD @cooperlewis_ Besides, there's no evidence of that. That's just an assumption.@Nathan011 @Christ_is_LORD @cooperlewis_ Of course not. It's illegal...@Nathan011 @Christ_is_LORD @cooperlewis_ that is the only available option because kidnapping is illegal.@Nathan011 @Christ_is_LORD @cooperlewis_ Right, but they are not kidnapped. They sold themselves into slavery.The writing on the Netflix Daredevil show is very intelligent.@Nathan011 @Christ_is_LORD @cooperlewis_ I don't have my own definition. I just use the definition relative to cultural context.@Nathan011 @Christ_is_LORD @cooperlewis_ The common definition of slavery entails that people are brought against their will.@Nathan011 @Christ_is_LORD @cooperlewis_ http://t.co/erkmTRaDiD@Nathan011 @Christ_is_LORD @cooperlewis_ there is no man-hunting or kidnapping. That was illegal to Jewish law.@Nathan011 @Christ_is_LORD @cooperlewis_ Right, that's the problem. The common definition of slavery isn't applicable to this discussion.@Nathan011 @Christ_is_LORD @cooperlewis_ Why isn't that guilty of the equivocal fallacy? You're using slavery in different way than we are.Riding a bicycle makes me feel at home.@RandomNobody86 @Christ_is_LORD @cooperlewis_ That does not bode well for strict materialism or metaphysical naturalism.I can honestly say that I have learned more in my own personal reading and writing than in school.@JacobAllee you might consider reposting this with the license plate number removed.@RandomNobody86 @Christ_is_LORD @cooperlewis_ Using the language of a "superior moral authority" presupposes a standard of morality.@RandomNobody86 @Christ_is_LORD @cooperlewis_ Also you're assuming a standard of morality that transcends humanity.@cooperlewis_ @Christ_is_LORD Since the bible forbids kidnapping &amp; Jesus told us to keep the whole word, we are restricted against slavery@cooperlewis_ @Christ_is_LORD Well I don't know anyone who wants to sell themselves into slavery.@cooperlewis_ @Christ_is_LORD No, it's an expansion of Exodus 21:16 which doesn't have that caveat. http://t.co/bJilTwbpyh@cooperlewis_ @Christ_is_LORD Roman slavery really was slavery.@cooperlewis_ @Christ_is_LORD I think a more serious and challenging discussion about slavery would be from the new testament.@cooperlewis_ @Christ_is_LORD Also remember that man-hunting is forbidden. So there's really no other option.@cooperlewis_ @Christ_is_LORD The one in the image? Why not? Someone sells themselves into slavery and then is punished for disobedience.@cooperlewis_ @Christ_is_LORD Most of these people would sell themselves into slavery and have the opportunity to leave.@cooperlewis_ @Christ_is_LORD Well the most immoral aspect of slavery is man - hunting and kidnapping. But Deuteronomy 24:7 forbids that.Debate tonight 10 PM ET. "Did Jesus Rise From The Dead?"

That is theological. But naturalistic evolution is not.@Radishfan228 @LetsTeachYou @RichardDawkins Strictly speaking, there is nothing innately theological about the theory of evolution.@Radishfan228 @LetsTeachYou @RichardDawkins There would only be overlap if the religion is true.@Radishfan228 @LetsTeachYou @RichardDawkins They are now known as "Religion." Because religion is distinct from theology.@Radishfan228 @LetsTeachYou @RichardDawkins No, that is nonsense. That is why so many secular universities renamed their theology department@Radishfan228 @LetsTeachYou @RichardDawkins That is not theology. Theology is studying God and his activities. That would be philosophy.@Radishfan228 @LetsTeachYou @RichardDawkins I think the word you are looking for is "philosophical," but that wouldn't be accurate either.@Radishfan228 @LetsTeachYou @RichardDawkins But there is no "study of God," which is what theology is.Diane Sawyer made several very basic errors throughout her piece on Islam on @ABC.Uber is easily the most convenient and cheapest public transportation I have ever used.@Radishfan228 @LetsTeachYou @RichardDawkins Evolution is a theological innovation?

It's a mistake to apply science to it.@mhuypens @Prophecy_YEC @Sibelius7 So Genesis 1, for example, takes Pagan gods and makes them impersonal, giving God supremacy over them.@mhuypens @Prophecy_YEC @Sibelius7 Yes exactly. Many of the biblical stories in the OT are about Israel's self-definition.@logicfrenzy @mhuypens @Prophecy_YEC @ScientiaPercept original sources to compare. Just hearsay on the internet.@logicfrenzy @mhuypens @Prophecy_YEC @ScientiaPercept That is nonsense. The Pagan comparisons are spurious. That's why you don't have the-@logicfrenzy @mhuypens @Prophecy_YEC @ScientiaPercept 12/25 came centuries later and was applied to his birth, not his death.@logicfrenzy @mhuypens @Prophecy_YEC @ScientiaPercept Lol.@mhuypens @Prophecy_YEC @Sibelius7 What I said was that science and scripture speak a different language. not talking about glossolalia.@Prophecy_YEC @Sibelius7  So astronomy is not a science either? It is also historical.@mhuypens @Prophecy_YEC @Sibelius7 ?@Prophecy_YEC @Sibelius7 @mhuypens We see the authors reflecting the understanding of cosmology as was present in the day.@Prophecy_YEC @Sibelius7 @mhuypens I don't agree. The Bible does not tend to speak to scientific issues. It speaks a different language.@mhuypens @Prophecy_YEC @ScientiaPercept Consult the historians. Ask about the evidence. Don't blindly accept some one-liner you read.@mhuypens @Prophecy_YEC @ScientiaPercept They are the Ken Ham's and Jason Lisle's of that discipline.@mhuypens @Prophecy_YEC @ScientiaPercept in the realm of historical scholarship, it is only a few on the fringe who hold this view.@Sibelius7 @Prophecy_YEC @ScientiaPercept How Jesus Became God.@Sibelius7 @Prophecy_YEC @ScientiaPercept You've read all of them? That's cool. I am thinking of doing a multipart video podcast of his book@mhuypens @Prophecy_YEC @ScientiaPercept The Jesus-mythicist is the young earth creationist within the discipline of history.@mhuypens @Prophecy_YEC @ScientiaPercept  Nope, the crucifixion of Jesus is, according to the majority of secular scholars, indisputable.@mhuypens @Prophecy_YEC @ScientiaPercept  Really, to deny the existence of Jesus as a historical figure is akin to denying the earth is old.@mhuypens @Prophecy_YEC @ScientiaPercept The answer is of course. The books of the new testament are part of that collection of evidence.@mhuypens @Prophecy_YEC @ScientiaPercept You should pose the question as such, "do the majority of secular scholars provide evidence?"@mhuypens @Prophecy_YEC @ScientiaPercept His crucifixion for instance is regarded as "indisputable," according to Gerd Ludemann, an atheist.@mhuypens @Prophecy_YEC @ScientiaPercept  Why don't you pose that question to the majority of scholars of history? They think Jesus existed.@mhuypens @Prophecy_YEC @ScientiaPercept  The Bible is not one source. Lol.@mhuypens @Prophecy_YEC @ScientiaPercept  But here is Ehrman's book. http://t.co/7f9gNLwbss@Sibelius7 @Prophecy_YEC @ScientiaPercept Maybe you should consider checking your sources rather than relying on memes and one-liners.@Sibelius7 @Prophecy_YEC @ScientiaPercept  Haha. Again, you are quoting Bart Ehrman, who argues vehemently that Jesus existed.@mhuypens @Prophecy_YEC @ScientiaPercept  Why would you except the Bible. They are part of the canon because they are the earliest sources.@mhuypens @Prophecy_YEC @ScientiaPercept I'm looking for Bart Ehrman videos. He apparently doesn't lecture much on this.@Prophecy_YEC @ScientiaPercept That is not to say that they wrote anything during his lifetime though.@richard_bushey over*@mhuypens @Prophecy_YEC @ScientiaPercept I often have to tell these Jesus-mythicists to check their own sources. Lol.@mhuypens @Prophecy_YEC @ScientiaPercept Lol, you're paraphrasing Bart Ehrman, who adamantly argues that Jesus existed.I wish I had more time to read about the radical midrashic interpretation of the gospels. Maybe of the summer.@Prophecy_YEC @ScientiaPercept But he does not claim that they wrote during his lifetime.@Prophecy_YEC @ScientiaPercept  Eye witnesses lived longer than Jesus. He died, they wrote later.@ScientiaPercept Out of curiosity, have you ever read any conservative scholarship on the authorship of the gospels?@Prophecy_YEC @ScientiaPercept Jesus did not say that the gospels were written during his lifetime.@ScientiaPercept @Prophecy_YEC And a good number of established historical figures.@ScientiaPercept @Prophecy_YEC Just as all accounts of 9/11 were written after the event. The same with the life of Alexander the Great.@ScientiaPercept @Prophecy_YEC Also, if I may strengthen your point, *all* scholars agree that the gospels were written after Jesus died.@ScientiaPercept @Prophecy_YEC (as long as we are reciting what ancient historians believe).@ScientiaPercept @Prophecy_YEC The supermajority of secular ancient historians also affirm the historicity of Jesus as a figure.@ScientiaPercept @Prophecy_YEC The majority of secular ancient historians reject the midrashic reading of the gospels.@_lungfish Right. I deny that.@_lungfish Most people have this view that the new testament cancels out the torah. You might hear "the OT is law, the NT is grace."@_lungfish Lol. I was actually restricted to Romans.I just realized that I only had to choose a topic for the essay that I just wrote. The actual essay won't be due for a few weeks. -.-@_lungfish I think that Christians are called the keep the moral precepts of the Torah. But that is not to say that we are justified by them@_lungfish Most Christians think that the Torah has no applicability. I think that stems from a misreading of Paul.I just wrote an offensive 12 page essay on the Christian's relationship to the Torah. @AdamRobles can relate.Paul routinely cited the Law to empower his case for grace alone through faith alone.@ScientiaPercept I sometimes make jokes.Just so everyone knows, I am not @ScientiaPercept.@ScientiaPercept @wpcguy  Also that statement would grammatically mean that you are Richard Bushey. "I, Richard Bushey, take this as..."@ScientiaPercept @wpcguy I just do not know why he thinks it is inappropriate to debate, yet is constantly debating on twitter.@wpcguy @ScientiaPercept "The truth isn't debatable..." Lol.I just met a pleasant oneness Pentecostal in Barnes and noble.@ScientiaPercept part 2 tonight?Conservative and liberal theologians have done a terrible job of cooperative scholarship. They're constantly at each other's throats.Just finished The Evolution of Adam by Peter Enns. Brilliant. His synthesis of evolution and the bible was first rate.There are some things that are absolutely true that make people so uncomfortable.@colasante re-follow me. I'm a much more pleasant tweeter than I used to be.Protestantism needs unity.@ScientiaPercept @wpcguy By the way, it is typically unwise to associate your business account with this sort of debate.@ScientiaPercept Did you see @wpcguy's response to my debate invitation? He just said, "I KNOW HE WON'T ANSWER MY QUESTIONS SO WHY BOTHER?"People in the ancient world did not think the same way that we think. Everybody reading this is a child of Descartes.Seeing how insecure people are has given me much respect for those who are willing to hear sacred beliefs put through rigorous criticism.@OriginalDrHill @ScientiaPercept I am just trying to figure out the best way to correspond to determine a good date and keep in touch.@OriginalDrHill @ScientiaPercept Sure, we can do that. Are you on FB?@OriginalDrHill I have a podcast and we are looking for intelligent people to come on and debate evolution with @ScientiaPercept.@colasante Lol! In a year you are going to deny recommending it like you did with Paranormal Activity.@colasante is anything on here worth while? http://t.co/cVdV7uJpNpOne professor told me I work too hard and provide too much detail, the other told me that my assignment was lazy. Need to find a balance.It is a manifestation of insecurity that makes a religious person hostile to anyone who disagrees with them.What is it about religious people that makes them hate those with whom they disagree?I have defeated the first wave of adware to infect my mac thanks to the Adware Medic app.@ScientiaPercept i think we should wait until Saturday to do our next one. Although I think that's the day of our origins debate.It makes me question the strength of a scholars case when they feel they need to stack the deck and say that all scholars agree with them.@wpcguy Yeah. If you're not confident in the arguments to bring them into open forum, then you shouldn't use them at all.@RichardDawkins There are some negatives that you can prove. There are no square circles.@wpcguy Lol. That's one way to admit that you wouldn't be able to keep up.@wpcguy Nobody votes. It's a discussion.  @ScientiaPercept@ScientiaPercept @leisure3000 @wpcguy I've said it before. Inviting people to debate is a conversation stopper. We won't hear from him again@leisure3000 @ScientiaPercept @wpcguy Lol you can't hijack my show!@wpcguy You can come on and debate @ScientiaPercept if you'd like.@colasante Yeah, him. Here it is. It went very well. https://t.co/oRyFg9C9LLThere are a few things that I'd actively campaign against. One is jihad. The other is tailgating.It is disgraceful and dangerous when a non-believer hears a Christian propagating nonsense about science. That's a cause of modern apostasy.@colasante I am doing a q&amp;a with scientia. Just him. In parts. Last night it was only an hour. Much easier consumption. Interested?The theory of evolution is something that should be taken seriously and cannot be refuted by our favorite one-liner.@colasante what do you do for hbo shows?@colasante do you have HBO Go?@muddasick @ScientiaPercept Are you a creationist?9 PM ET, I hosting an interview with @ScientiaPercept on common objections to #evolution. live here: https://t.co/oRyFg9TLal #atheism@ScientiaPercept Yeah!@ScientiaPercept are we going on tonight?@_lungfish Are you a Christian or an atheist? I cannot tell.@ElijiahT @_lungfish @terxic (I just wanted to join in the fun.)@ElijiahT @_lungfish @terxic What does science have to do with objective morality?@RumblingHoof @ScientiaPercept You don't think that Herod was an actual person?@RumblingHoof @ScientiaPercept Which is fine. Some people prefer not to think about their beliefs. That's not your thing. I understand.@RumblingHoof @ScientiaPercept If all you have is the word "yes" with no latitude, then I can see why you wouldn't want to participate.@RumblingHoof @ScientiaPercept Lol. Yeah you sound like quite an astute thinker.@RumblingHoof @ScientiaPercept Why doesn't that commit the tu quoque fallacy?@RumblingHoof Well evolution probably wouldn't be the topic. Maybe the topic would be, "is the bible full of myths?" @ScientiaPercept@RumblingHoof @ScientiaPercept Really? All of that trash talking and then you back down when challenged? That's a shame.@ScientiaPercept By the way, I will be available tonight at 9. What about you?@RumblingHoof My friend @ScientiaPercept is an evolutionary biologist and an atheist who has been on several times and he will vouch for me.I think it is hilarious when people send me messages bragging about how intelligent they are.@RumblingHoof @ScientiaPercept Lol. Want to come on the podcast? I'd love to have someone as intelligent as you on to discuss religion.@RumblingHoof @ScientiaPercept @ICRscience And that wouldn't be you, right? You're quite learned. Is that what you are saying?@RumblingHoof @ScientiaPercept @ICRscience Hmm, I am not sure if you are the ideal candidate with whom I'd want to engage in conversation.@RumblingHoof @ScientiaPercept @ICRscience Also the old book is God-breathed. :)@RumblingHoof @ScientiaPercept @ICRscience I am not sure who are you are talking to.@ScientiaPercept Sorry. But actually i think that tomorrow might be better. currently at barnes and noble with a lot of homework.@ScientiaPercept Yes sounds good.@ScientiaPercept  I just sent an e-mail to @ICRscience inviting them to debate the age of the earth on the podcast.@DrOakley1689 I think he sent an e-mail through the aomin contact form last night if you want to look out for it.RT @ElijiahT: "I know why I haven't been able to sell my house! I need to bury a statue of St. Joseph!" - my superstitious catholic coworker@DrOakley1689 A friend of mine who is a Oneness Pentecostal is considering converting after watching your videos for the last few months.Any atheists want to come on a podcast tonight and talk about religion? #atheism@ScientiaPercept If you want something to do instead, I recommend this debate: https://t.co/cpISbCIu8r Very entertaining.@ScientiaPercept Alright, we can do that.@ScientiaPercept I was planning on accusing you of looking with different lens. You wouldn't have been able to handle that objection anyway.@ScientiaPercept That's a shame. I guess I'll just go watch the walking dead.At 9 PM ET I will interview @ScientiaPercept on common objections to #evolution. Watch live here https://t.co/oRyFg9TLal #Atheism@ScientiaPercept I was hoping to get a RT from Dawkins. But he doesn't know us so it's understandable.@ScientiaPercept Sure.@wwwRILEYcom speed of light is what I have in mind.@CounterApologis Great. A lot of atheists actually concede that point.@CounterApologis Yeah he is great. He has been on several shows. I'd love to set something up between you two.@CounterApologis "this gives me grounds for belief, but wouldn't be grounds for your belief."@CounterApologis Really? That's interesting. To clarify, I am talking about an argument that says...When people say "The rate of X might've changed..." isn't that to abandon the uniformity of nature? Just a question, not an accusation.@ScientiaPercept It never hurts an audience to hear something twice. As a teacher you know that people don't retain everything they hear.@CounterApologis I just need a more catchy title for that. Lol. I might want to read Warranted Christian Belief before hosting that one.@ScientiaPercept I assume that there is nothing that I can bring up that will catch you off guard.@ScientiaPercept For tonight I will probably just look up one of Kent Hovind's or Ken Ham's "best objections to evolution." Or something.@ScientiaPercept @EDebunked Just to clarify, tonight I do not really want a debate. But another time definitely.@RichardDawkins Interviewing evol. biologist (@ScientiaPercept) on objections to evolution. RT? live here 10 pm ET: https://t.co/oRyFg9TLal@CounterApologis "Am I justified for believing in Christianity based on my personal experiences of the holy spirit?" R U Interested in that?@CounterApologis I'd like to host a debate on this:@CounterApologis Yeah I thought of that. There might be some overlap. If you'd like I can choose a different topic.I will interview @ScientiaPercept tomorrow night about common objections to #evolution. I'll share the broadcasting link tomorrow. #atheism@JacobAllee Currently looking for other candidates. I even e-mailed CARM. Lol. I will find someone.@JacobAllee So the guys i had who think Lewis was heretic were happy to proclaim it on FB but not in a debate where they'd be challenged.RT @_lungfish: My favorite thing to say to my wife in order to annoy her is "not true given mind-body dualism."@GammaAtheist Do you guys do debates or is it all atheists?We are destroying speculations and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God (2 Corinthians 10:5).@CounterApologis I'm going to try to find a good opponent then we can all correspond to determine a date. I'll get back to you.I am finding that I get along with atheists fairly well when we aren't doomed to only twitter conversations. Looking forward to next podcast@CounterApologis thinking of another debate. "Does the gospel make sense?" Or "is the gospel good news?" Any interest?We move to the higher echelons of scholarship known as conjecture.Paul did not consider glossolalia to be a spiritual measuring stick, but one gift that is given to some (1 Cor 12:4-7, 14:4-5).@peterboghossian @FaS_Skeptic Couldn't I say that about anything rational?

"Is #Evolution At Odds With #Atheism?" https://t.co/qqN8vlBlj9 #Apologetics #Jesus@colasante here is the link to watch live or later. One of my debaters is named Eric. https://t.co/qqN8vlBlj9@CounterApologis Of course that might lead me to a follow up question. Is science useless without an infallible interpretation of evidence?@CounterApologis  Of course it might argued that this was more of a misapplication of hermeneutics.I am sympathetic to that. Hermeneutics are often just the practice of manufacturing an apologetic for an interpretation. @CounterApologis@CounterApologis Didn't the opposite happen to you?@HelpingQuestion that's a good tip. I have heard that one before.Writer's block. Maybe I'll just borrow something by Spurgeon or Jonathan Edwards for this Sunday's sermon.@ElijiahT No they don't.@colasante hosting another live debate tonight at 7 PST. It's on the topic "is evolution at odds with atheism?" You should tune in.@CounterApologis Perhaps I'll call you William Lane Craig. Just to draw traffic.@CounterApologis I can choose a fake name for you if you want to protect your identity. How about Finnius McClintock?@wwwRILEYcom follow me. I'll need to PM the permalink to you.@CounterApologis yeah I can do that.@JesusFan2009 @CounterApologis @wwwRILEYcom @Panhead93 he just confirmed.

So I am not overly biased as a moderator.@CounterApologis @wwwRILEYcom Should be a great debate. I am looking forward to it.@CounterApologis @wwwRILEYcom Hey guys. Please confirm that you are still planning to participate tomorrow night at 10 PM ET.@richard_bushey well I can still be an inerrantist and say that.I wonder if a paramedic in the ambulance ever told the snake-handlers that the last 12 verses of Mark are inauthentic.Presently reading Till We Have Faces. Another masterpiece by CS Lewis
I'd have loved to meet him.@Prophecy_YEC @ScientiaPercept @apologist215 Thanks for the plug.We do not perform textual criticism upon the Origin of Species. OOS was a starting point. @DanThaWildMan @sinatheist666 @chrishart0130That sounds very much like nonsense, @DanThaWildMan. Evolution can contradict Darwin's writings. @sinatheist666 @chrishart0130Excited for "Does God Exist?" debate @ScientiaPercept V Robert Rowe Vs @apologist215 @ 10 PM ET. Live here: https://t.co/YugREFPR4I #atheismRT @Rev_Norespect: #Confessions To test my faith I sometimes look right at the 1% milk and ask "Wilt thou be made whole?"@ScientiaPercept Good. I have a lot of trouble finding young earthers who are willing to debate on the podcast. It's sort of frustrating.@ScientiaPercept we should have a 3 yec's vs 1 (you) discussion if we could find the people. That'd be fun.I often skip William Lane Craig's opening speeches in debates because I've heard it so many times.@AtyHans @A_Kraw @tgnoble @CatDudeScott @DanThaWildMan The shouldn't be treated as natural events because that isn't what they are.@AtyHans @A_Kraw @tgnoble @CatDudeScott @DanThaWildMan  But that's not the point. The objection is that miracles occur in the Bible.@A_Kraw @tgnoble @AtyHans @CatDudeScott @DanThaWildMan The Bible is written with the presupposition that God exists and interacts in world.@A_Kraw @tgnoble @AtyHans @CatDudeScott @DanThaWildMan It's not that it happened naturally.@A_Kraw @tgnoble @AtyHans @CatDudeScott @DanThaWildMan It just depends on whether you believe in miracles.@AtyHans @tgnoble @A_Kraw @CatDudeScott @DanThaWildMan It's just a different classification system. The one in the Bible is more primitive.@AtyHans @tgnoble @A_Kraw @CatDudeScott @DanThaWildMan The distinction "bat" was made thousands of years after that passage was written.@ElijiahT preach it brotha.@ScientiaPercept @Prophecy_YEC But I didn't even say that. I just pointed out what I observed.@ScientiaPercept @Prophecy_YEC I think the strawman that he is referring to is the dichotomy of science vs young earth creation.@FaS_Skeptic I have used it in the past to edit/upload videos and sermons before i was aware of Hangouts.@FaS_Skeptic No, I just stream from Hangout and it immediately archives. I didn't think editing was an option with that method.@FaS_Skeptic yeah the only thing that i do not like about iMovie is that it takes forever to upload.@FaS_Skeptic I've been hosting shows on Google Hangout/YouTube. Do you think that is better/worse than the way you guys do it?@HelpingQuestion send me a friend request https://t.co/GiAikziWF4Tonight at 10 PM ET, @ScientiaPercept will debate Robert Rowe on the topic of God's existence. Listen here: https://t.co/YugREFPR4I #Atheism@BibleReloaded @nonprophetess  Alright, just messaged you.@BibleReloaded @nonprophetess that's cool. then you know that documents can have errors and still contain actual history.@BibleReloaded @nonprophetess  I just use my YouTube channel. You can find the rest of them by going to my profile in the link i just sent.@BibleReloaded @nonprophetess The task of the historian, for instance, is deciphering what is historical from what is non-historical.@BibleReloaded @nonprophetess Right. Well there can be accounts of things that are generally reliable even if some details are off.@BibleReloaded @nonprophetess Here is the video if you are interested. https://t.co/qQyfdUmSFJ@BibleReloaded @nonprophetess We touched on that. You might find the answers/perspectives unique.@BibleReloaded @nonprophetess I actually hosted a debate (between Christians) about whether there are errors in the Bible.@BibleReloaded @nonprophetess  See, that's an assumption. Where did I say that the Bible was inerrant?@BibleReloaded @nonprophetess Or in text in general. Nobody understand each other.@BibleReloaded @nonprophetess  Fine, fair enough. That is why I just told her that I don't like conversations on twitter.@BibleReloaded @nonprophetess  Then perhaps consider asking me rather than telling me what I think. That'd be a bit more polite.@nonprophetess I will. On podcast. This is exhausting.@BibleReloaded @nonprophetess So like I said, I am not really interested in talking to you.@BibleReloaded @nonprophetess  That's fine. You seem like one of those guys who is only interested in crushing people and winning debates.@nonprophetess No. I did not say that either.@BibleReloaded @nonprophetess  The way you summarized it was misrepresenting.@BibleReloaded @nonprophetess That isn't what I said. That is a misrepresentation. I did not say that it was a priori.@nonprophetess Agreed. I didn't say that.@nonprophetess when I say evidence, I do not mean, "this establishes this truth on its' own." that is not necessary to qualify as evidence@nonprophetess  How is it not? It is one piece of evidence. Every religious document alone that refers to cosmology is one piece of evidence@nonprophetess Which I find it surprising that anybody would disagree with that.@nonprophetess I agree with that. That is not what i said. I said that the bible is evidence of what people have believed.@nonprophetess I am not sure what you're referencing. The example that I have been going with is ancient cosmology.@nonprophetess  But we do know that it came out of the ancient near east. That is not being contested, right? I'd be very surprised.@nonprophetess I think we are talking passed each other. I am not saying that the Bible *alone* is evidence of ANC.@nonprophetess But we can look at the historical record (the Bible is one piece of that) as evidence for what these people believed.@nonprophetess It disproves it.@nonprophetess Again, doesn't matter. I am talking about near eastern cosmology. Very outdated. Modern science doesnt prove that.@nonprophetess That doesn't matter. It is still one piece of evidence out of many.@nonprophetess Probably most of the "pieces of the puzzle" are religious texts.@nonprophetess Religious texts are some of the best evidences for what people believed in the past.@nonprophetess But it is still evidence, isn't it? I can look at the Bible and see ancient near eastern cosmology.@nonprophetess @BibleReloaded it is not an assumption, right?@nonprophetess @BibleReloaded Wait, now that would be the next part of the conversation. *If* it is based on evidence, then you'd agree that@nonprophetess So are the other sources. If you remove any of them, you have removed a piece of evidence.@nonprophetess But it is still a piece of evidence supporting ancient near eastern cosmology.@BibleReloaded @nonprophetess I do not think that I am interested in talking to you if you are going to make assumptions about me.@BibleReloaded @nonprophetess  Oh okay. Thanks for letting me know about my thought process.@nonprophetess @BibleReloaded Only if it is an assumption rather than based on evidence.@nonprophetess Now this is one reason that I prefer podcasts to twitter discussions. What I want to express doesn't get through in 140 chars@nonprophetess Yes. I agree with that. But I am thinking of the statement, "the bible isn't evidence," strictly speaking, wouldn't be true.@BibleReloaded @nonprophetess But once you are there, then you are within that paradigm and you interpret everything through it.@BibleReloaded @nonprophetess  You know, I actually agree with that.@nonprophetess That is a rather sweeping statement though isn't it? For instance, the Bible is evidence of ancient near eastern cosmology.@nonprophetess I think that it is a little unfair of you to say that when I think I have done just the opposite.@nonprophetess To fit the evidence.@nonprophetess I'd deny what is difficult to reconcile. But, in this article, what I have done is show that my beliefs are being altered.@nonprophetess cohesive and consistent belief. If I wanted to just force the evidence to fit my beliefs, I'd just alter the evidence.@nonprophetess What I am doing is asking how the various strands of evidence, including the Bible, and the natural world, can produce a@nonprophetess After reading about your discussions with Mormons on evolution, Adam&amp;Eve, you might like my article http://t.co/E9CUMKWRfe@nonprophetess @ScientiaPercept FB might be easier if you have that.@nonprophetess @ScientiaPercept  Candice, I just e-mailed you.@DanThaWildMan @A_Kraw @AtyHans you think that you have to observe phenomenon to know that it occurred?@A_Kraw @DanThaWildMan @AtyHans Well it depends on the geology 101 student. Many 19 year olds are pretty absent minded. :P@AtyHans @DanThaWildMan @ScientiaPercept I think talking snakes are naturally impossible. But if God exists, then it'd just be a miracle.@HelpingQuestion Google Hangout. I think i've asked this already, but are you on FB? that'd be easier."You assume uniformitarianism." - @DanThaWildMan

If so, then there are transitional stages.@nonprophetess Yo. Always looking for intelligent atheists to come on my podcast. Any interest?@DanThaWildMan @SkepticStuff @chrishart0130 biologists acknowledge piltdown man as a hoax. That's not really significant.@JacobAllee alright.

It hasn't happened yet though and that'd be hard to do on Hangouts. But okay. Lol.@jgregorypa You are welcome to come on as well. Always looking for atheists to debate. @ScientiaPercept@chrishart0130 @ScientiaPercept @DanThaWildMan Lol oh my goodness.@chrishart0130 @ScientiaPercept @DanThaWildMan All of these young earth creationists come out except when I am looking for them.@ScientiaPercept @DanThaWildMan Haha okay.@wwwRILEYcom @ScientiaPercept No, sorry. We are post-poning. One of the guys dropped out last minute.@DanThaWildMan @ScientiaPercept  What didn't he address?@ScientiaPercept @Prophecy_YEC He might be. If not, I'd find another old earth creationist.@Prophecy_YEC We could do that. @ScientiaPercept  what do you think?@Tinawanis Add me on FB and we'll discuss it. https://t.co/GiAikziWF4@Tinawanis Hmm, how about something else? We could think of a topic. Also it doesn't have to be tonight.@Prophecy_YEC @Tinawanis @ScientiaPercept @DanThaWildMan @just_a_servant @cfrost1178 Not sure. probably will have to just postpone.@JacobAllee Hey Jacob. Would you ever engage in a podcast debate about "was CS Lewis a heretic?" I know some ppl who think that he was.@Tinawanis  What about you? Want to come on? :P I haven't had any females on yet and I will probably be accused of sexism if I don't soon.@Tinawanis Finding people last minute usually doesn't work out. I'm a little annoyed that my guy dropped just 20 mins before starting.@Tinawanis Thanks. :)@Tinawanis @ScientiaPercept @DanThaWildMan @Prophecy_YEC @just_a_servant @cfrost1178 Like now. Lol.@Tinawanis @ScientiaPercept @DanThaWildMan @Prophecy_YEC @just_a_servant @cfrost1178 Hey guys.

I still don't endorse that title. But I will look.@ScientiaPercept what do you think @Prophecy_YEC ? Busy tonight?@ScientiaPercept he said he had to work.@ScientiaPercept Robert josh@wwwRILEYcom probably not.

So I'd like to put you on for that.@Davidik1970 Alright. The other atheist that I have interested in 1 is @SecularOutpost. I was planning on doing 2 vs 2 so that is good.@tastypaper yeah that's true. I have wanted to have a more coversational podcsst with an atheist.@wwwRILEYcom Usually around 10 PM ET. Around 2 hrs. Informal discussion. 2 vs 2. The other atheist on that topic is @CounterApologis@HelpingQuestion @ScientiaPercept So on evolution and naturalism, says Plantinga, it is unlikely that our cognitive faculties would function@HelpingQuestion @ScientiaPercept No. It is Alvin Plantinga's proposal that beliefs do not have to be true if they lead one to survival.@tastypaper Maybe if they said that fairies existed. So what do you want to talk about?@Prophecy_YEC Sure, we can do that. Although I am actually having one on the age of the earth tomorrow night. Maybe the topic isn't the best@Prophecy_YEC 10 PM ET.@CounterApologis I usually do it at around 10 PM ET, so any night is usually fine. Are you on FB?@Prophecy_YEC i'd probably like to get a few others.@SecularOutpost yep i just added you.@CounterApologis Alright. How much time? Btw the guy that wants to have this discussion would like it to be 2 vs 2.@Prophecy_YEC What are you doing tonight? Want to have a YEC/OEC podcast discussion?Something I appreciate about atheists is they are willing to debate the issues. There are many religious people who hide from criticism.@SecularOutpost alright. Let me know when you have an account and i'll add you as a friend.@SecularOutpost Are you on Google+? It'd be easier to coordinate date/time and everything if we were all in a chatroom together.@CounterApologis I remember you telling me that you were too busy to debate. Is that still true?@Prophecy_YEC Well for clarity's sake &amp; since he wouldn't accept that label, and would just be insulted, I decided to make that distinction.@SecularOutpost @exapologist @CounterApologis Informal discussion.@SecularOutpost @exapologist @CounterApologis That would is supposed to be about 2 weeks from now. Probably on the weekend.@SecularOutpost @exapologist @CounterApologis So if you've watched Hugh Ross, it would be akin to that sort of argumentation.@SecularOutpost @exapologist @CounterApologis The fine-tuning argument.

Also I just e-mailed @apologist215 about coming on to debate the age of the earth.@ScientiaPercept @swesley_perth yes. Still hoping to find a partner for Josh.@ScientiaPercept @swesley_perth just yo clarify, I wasn't trying to stump you with that chicken question.

Hmm...Dan Barker behaved poorly and immaturely in his debate with James White (@DrOakley1689).@ScientiaPercept Do you think that t-rex evolving into a chicken would be against natural selection?

I'm not writing a biography. Lol@ElijiahT @FaS_Skeptic I agree with that. I think colleges should focus more on essays than the tests.@wheeless_kyle @FaS_Skeptic @ElijiahT no it was a bachelor's. She's currently pursuing a masters.@FaS_Skeptic @ElijiahT A girl who had a degree in biology from a secular university said that to me. It was surprising."There is no significant scientific statement that I can think of that doesn't have theological overtones." - Hugh Ross (@RTB_HRoss)@colasante Talking to Robert and Scientia has interested me much more in the natural sciences.I just received an e-mail from Reasons To Believe. Hugh Ross would like to send me a copy of his latest, updated copy of A Matter of Days.@colasante is the screenplay that you are writing for work?@colasante Have you started watching the debate?@colasante I am wondering about the general perception of Christians.@colasante  are a wacky religious fanatic, or an idiot, or a bigot, or not someone you would want to be friends with? Just curious.@colasante when somebody tells you that they are a Christian, what is the immediate judgment that you make? (If any)? Do you think that theyWhen we look at the sun, we see it as it was eight minutes ago.@nazam44 No that is not what he said. He accused James White of saying that. He misrepresented the argument to deceive the audience.@nazam44 Yes, absolutely. Here is the debate. https://t.co/Wp5qYFv3VC@colasante Also tell me if you can discern my view. Someone complimented me for being even-handed. I tried to question everyone univocally.@ScientiaPercept I'm going to have to mute my mic when I am not talking. The video keeps going back to me!Do not let anyone tell you that cosmology changes every 5 years.

Pointless.@Playdoughpoem @ScientiaPercept @SeeingGod7  What i meant is that there is a lot of latitude. Not that you need the right book.@Playdoughpoem @ScientiaPercept @SeeingGod7 I am not sure what that would even imply. But I read everything.@Playdoughpoem @ScientiaPercept @SeeingGod7 How many apologetic books on the NT written by Christians have you read since de-converting?@Playdoughpoem @ScientiaPercept @SeeingGod7 I do not know how you expect to have a discussion of one-liners to resolve that.@Playdoughpoem @ScientiaPercept @SeeingGod7 I mean, you give a shotgun of arguments, each of which have entire books written about them@Playdoughpoem @ScientiaPercept @SeeingGod7  I'm not interested in 140 char debates.

It depends on the genre.@CounterApologis  Now when apologists make these arguments, they do not just slap that label on them. It is based on the genre of literature@CounterApologis But there is not really a connection between the flood and the resurrection in the absence of inerrancy.@604xo That would make no sense whatsoever in the context to interpret it as literal. It would be completely random and out of left field.@604xo In this way, it is not a literal sword.  The context makes that clear. That is what Matthew wanted us to understand.@604xo In this case, the context makes it clear that the author was not trying to relay a principle of violence but separation of families.@604xo If you are going to seriously read any text, you need to ask the question, "what did the author intend to relay by writing this?"@604xo I did not say that. I am saying that you cannot take one line to change the principle of the text. It is not written in a vacuum.@604xo Here is the context. It matters. http://t.co/inhkI8Pctm@604xo No, you are wrong. These are two different passages. Read Matthew 10. The context is obvious.@CounterApologis That is not to put words in your mouth. But this tweet seems to question inerrancy and therefore question the resurrection.@CounterApologis It seems like a lot of your complaints are about inerrancy. But the resurrection-apologetics do not assume inerrancy.@AmerElsaad @Siddizzy Lol well it is there. Sahih Muslim 1:33. Here is the screenshot. http://t.co/gVbqdcdcmU@AmerElsaad @Siddizzy Here is the online version. Scroll down to hadith 33, you will find it. http://t.co/3CzUQb4FR3@AmerElsaad @Siddizzy My mistake. It is book 1 ("the book of faith"), hadith 33.@604xo Read the very next verse. That is quote-mining. In context, he is talking about families being set against each other for the gospel."I have been commanded to fight against people until they testify that Muhammad the messenger of Allah." - Muhammad (Sahih Muslim 33) #Islam@Emmyjewel If not, then I can be sure that you are not intellectually honest and you're just looking for zingers to get people.@Emmyjewel But the picture is wrong about Matthew 18:6. Do you deny that?@Emmyjewel That is such a surface misreading. The rational man can hardly be blamed for suspicion that it was intentionally misrepresented.@Emmyjewel Matthew 18:6 says that when people lead children to sin, it would be better for *them* if they were drowned. Not the children.@FaS_Skeptic @CarltonWhitfie8 Sorry I misread what you said.@FaS_Skeptic why is that?  @CarltonWhitfie8@CarltonWhitfie8 @FaS_Skeptic You're pretty brilliant for noticing that.

Only by the grace of God do we overcome that.@AtheistAdvocate @CreatednotEvlvd I am really convinced that you are objecting just for the sake of it.@AtheistAdvocate @CreatednotEvlvd Since God's chosen method is written communication, it follows that there will be written communication.@AtheistAdvocate @CreatednotEvlvd If not, you affirm that there is a considerable passage of time for God to communicate to a large group@AtheistAdvocate @CreatednotEvlvd Do you deny it is a precedent?

Although it does not matter much if that is too much trouble@FaS_Skeptic By the way, if you use a picture of me when you publish the debate, I'd prefer my twitter pic to the captain crunch one.@RobsBarrow @UPCIORG Looking for an intelligent UPCI member with interest in religiously oriented broadcasted debate. Any suggestions?@JacobAllee I would find that error hilarious if unknowing people were not taken in by it.@colasante Nervous?Reading Miracles by CS Lewis. He seems to hit on every point that I made in the FaS debate last night. Shame I didn't read it before.Those of us who have had a philosophical education find it impossible to think that scientists mean what they seem to say. CS Lewis"There is no distinction between Jew and Greek," was a radical message when Paul was preaching.@Abdul_chelseafc But that isn't really what the text says.@hed5aya Oh okay. So It's not really addressed to Muhammad and you don't expect him to hear it. I think I get what you mean.@clickme_dollxo But doesn't that make Muhammad omniscient? Since he can hear people all over the world?@hed5aya It seems to almost attribute omniscience to him, sort of like the Catholic conception of Mary. @jenn_ruth @imraansiddiqi@hed5aya But in addressing Muhammad, isn't it at least prayer-like? He can hear people all over the world? @jenn_ruth @imraansiddiqi@ISlam_love_him It was upstaged by the Bible. Job 9:8, Isaiah 40:22, 42:5. 44;24,45:12, 48:13, 51:13, Zec 12:1, Psalm 104:2, Jer 51:15 10:12@SuperTheologian What is worldly wisdom?@jenn_ruth @imraansiddiqi Of course I am not an Islamic theologian, but it seems to be addressed to Muhammad.@jenn_ruth @imraansiddiqi Oh okay. What is the Islamic view of the statement, "Peace be upon you, O Prophet,"? which is part of the prayer.@FaS_Skeptic @Thinking_Theist When do you plan to put it online?@jenn_ruth @imraansiddiqi Would you say that prayer is a form of or a part of worship?@imraansiddiqi @jenn_ruth Although I do not get why spell it 'Moslems' or 'Mohammad.' It is a way of saying "I'm an ignorant American."@imraansiddiqi @jenn_ruth Is that a slur? CS Lewis did it a few times, and never with any disdain.@colasante Will have the link tomorrow. I think I did pretty well. But try to not be too negative in your feedback. It was my first debate.@AtheistAdvocate I think we will have to do another one. Something more specific. Like the resurrection or the cosmological argument.@FaS_Skeptic @Thinking_Theist I would like to be a more frequent guest. I can come on and discuss anything. Especially natural theology.@YeshuaElohim Lol, you're very arrogant. No thanks.@YeshuaElohim No but they are part of my coursework, so I will in the future.@AtheistAdvocate Whew! Well done. Great to hear your voice. Stay safe out there.@AtheistAdvocate Hey, we're waiting on you. Afraid that you might have gotten the time change mixed up.@YeshuaElohim I do not agree. I think that the Greek and Hebrew are very valuable. But I think that the translations are trustworthy.@FaS_Skeptic @AtheistAdvocate  Also I am not sure if you are aware, but you have not yet added your question to the 6th point.@FaS_Skeptic Added. By the way, have you heard from @AtheistAdvocate today and confirmed that he is still coming on?@islamicmonthly It seems appropriate considering the recent attacks. people are wondering if this is what Islam really is.@islamicmonthly Looking for an intelligent, respectful Muslim to have gentleman's debate. Live, broadcasted.@FaS_Skeptic @AtheistAdvocate will we have the opportunity to introduce ourselves or did you plan to do that for us?Conservatives say that the media placates Muslims by not reporting terrorist stories. Liberals say the media demonizes Muslims by reporting.@SafeensS It is appropriate given the attacks. People are wondering, "Is this the real Islam?" I'll answer yes in the debate. You answer no.@SafeensS Would you be interested in a gentleman's radio debate about whether Islam is a religion of peace? Or whether Jesus was a Muslim?@FaS_Skeptic Or you may prefer to try to catch me off guard.@FaS_Skeptic I think I am pretty good at preparation, so I may already have it covered. But how would you feel about sharing your questions?@FaS_Skeptic How much do you and Jason get involved in the conversation?@FaS_Skeptic Oh, that is good.

He is nice guy. I think it will be a gentleman's discussion.Why does science work? Why should we expect science to work?

The only recourse is violence. #CharlieHebdo@sneekinsneekout @Pearlexative @jenn_ruth From reading Sahih Bukhari, I am convinced that Muhammad would utterly condemn the western Islam.@sneekinsneekout @Pearlexative @jenn_ruth The western version of Islam is docile. But Islam wasn't born in the west.@sneekinsneekout  I am not sure one ought to point the finger &amp; accuse "you were molested!" Not very sympathetic. @Pearlexative @jenn_ruth@jenn_ruth I'm not sure that I'd want the indictment to be "you're making people hate Islam," as much as, "you're murdering people."The rebellion of scientists against theology is akin to the rebellion of the branches against the tree.@ArminianSupes @CalvinistProbs I think Romans 11 is stronger with regard to individual unconditional election. Ch. 9 seems to be corporate.@_BrianMcLean Isn't that what Paul did in Romans 8:18 and 2nd Corinthians 4:17?@jahshu That's the Qur'an's argument for itself.Few have been as adamant a proponent of salvation by faith to the exclusion of works or water baptism than Paul the apostle.@Artturi Well there's an element of natural science and metaphysics. It can be engaged by non-religious theists or classical theists.@tsdown44_tracy @AmericanAtheist @shmermel You are a man of great faith. I do not share your faith. I cannot make that confession of faith.@tsdown44_tracy @AmericanAtheist @shmermel Lol. Okay, so you make a random assertion by blind faith and then you start insulting. On par@ArtturiArtturi Natural theology is the inference of God in the natural world and our reason without appeal to divine revelation.@DellaTorre9 What do you think of the liberal theology of the Jesus Seminar?@tsdown44_tracy @AmericanAtheist @shmermel So you must either believe in psychic powers or you are just saying things by blind faith.@tsdown44_tracy @AmericanAtheist @shmermel You asserted by your blind faith that I made it up. You had no reason to, you just said it.@tsdown44_tracy @AmericanAtheist @shmermel No, you said that I made it up. Which means that you believe in psychics.If you can make a rhyme as fine as mine, it must be divine.@tsdown44_tracy @AmericanAtheist @shmermel It sounds like you are just saying things even if you do not know that they are true.@tsdown44_tracy @AmericanAtheist @shmermel I didn't read it in a book or hear someone else say it? I made it up?@tsdown44_tracy @AmericanAtheist @shmermel Yeah? You know the origins of that thought that I had?

See you Friday! @YeshuaElohim@AtheistAdvocate What you are doing is straight up circular reasoning. You assumed your conclusion. @YeshuaElohim@AtheistAdvocate You do not say, "this document teaches ABCDE. I disagree with D. Therefore A is false." That is ridiculous. @YeshuaElohim@AtheistAdvocate ...? It does not sound like you are too familiar with how historians investigate ancient sources. @YeshuaElohim@AtheistAdvocate @YeshuaElohim they arr thr most reliable. They are not only scripture. Theyre ancient biographies.@AtheistAdvocate @YeshuaElohim Why would you go outside of the best historical documents that we have? They're canonical precisely because@FaS_Skeptic @AtheistAdvocate I'd like an outline too so I can prepare accordingly.

But still there.@jahshu I think that it is important to talk about expectations, feelings we have, and our behavior.@jahshu Google it. It's about a decade old.Deeply grieved by the impact of liberal theology, Bill Craig was close to tears towards the end of his debate with John Shelby Sprong.Since the American Atheists ardently oppose religious holidays, they also ought not take the weekends off. That, too, has religious origins.@SuperTheologian Sometimes I wonder if the attacks from evangelicals on @JoelOsteen are undue.

Especially his evangelistic efforts and the 180 Movie.@SecretBunny7 Or if not plainly false, ought to be subject to rational skepticism (something lost on most atheists).@SecretBunny7 But the reasoning in the meme is that you must first prove something for it to be disproved. That's plainly false.Drinking coffee is part of  being an adult.@moinedeisme Yes I agree with you.@moinedeisme Sometimes it seems like people allow the bar to shift based on what they want to be true.
