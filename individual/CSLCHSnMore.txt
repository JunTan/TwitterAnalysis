--Psalm 122:1Excuses, excuses.... https://t.co/kAv5JnnD1WSurely Thy sweet and wondrous love
 Shall measure all my dayes;
And as it never shall remove,
 So neither shall my praise.Nay, Thou dost make me sit and dine,
 Ev’n in my enemies sight:
My head with oyl, my cup with wine
 Runnes over day and night.Yea, in death's shadie black abode
 Well may I walk, not fear:
For Thou art with me; and Thy rod
 To guide, Thy staff to bear.Or if I stray, He doth convert
And bring my minde in frame:
And all this not for my desert,
But for His holy name.He leads me to the tender grasse,
 Where I both feed and rest;
Then to the streams that gently passe:
  In both I have the best.Psalm 23 by George Herbert

The God of love my shepherd is,
And He that doth me feed:
While He is mine &amp; I am His,
What can I want or need?A little (VERY little) coffee poetry:

Roses are red,

Rhyming is hard...
Coffee.https://t.co/Pw4wtbG2wPBless, bless the Conqueror slain—
Slain by Divine decree—
Who lived, who died, 
Who lives again,
For thee, His saint, for thee!He hell in hell laid low;
Made sin, He sin o’erthrew:
Bowed to the grave, destroyed it so, 
And death, by dying, slew.By weakness and defect
He won the meed and crown;
Trod all our foes beneath His feet,
By being trodden down.His be the Victor’s name
Who fought our fight alone:
Triumphant saints no honour claim;
Their conquest was His own.What though th’ accuser roar
Of ills that I have done;
I know them well,
and thousands more:
Jehovah knoweth none.Sure....blame it on the coffee. https://t.co/huJqOnyBgGYou can throw the whole weight of your anxieties upon him, for you are his personal concern.

Bill  #HealthyfaithThanks to all who shared your ideas and heart. Have a blessed weekend. Bill  #HealthyfaithFinal Q8 – Are you ever aware that the Holy Spirit is in your life and leading you? How do you know?-  #Healthyfaith@MisterTR21 I'm not always clear. Too often. I mean, If he lives in us, why doesn't does HE have every part of our lives? #HealthyfaithQ –Some are confused about the word “filled” with the Spirit. Filled does not mean having a full dose What does “filled” mean? #Healthyfaith@preacherman_116 Thanks Stephen. Great weekend. Bill #HealthyfaithQ6 –We have the life-giving Spirit of God when we are saved, why doesn’t He have all of us all the time? What’s the problem? #HealthyfaithWhen we receive God's Spirit into our lives and become one with Him, we have him (Jesus, Father, H.S.)

He is our personal, beloved friend and guide, No impersonal force. #Healthyfaith@preacherman_116 Good word and reminder Stephen. #HealthyfaithQ3 -  The word Spirit in many religions refers to a force or source of energy.

I trace the rainbow through the rain,That in Thy sunshine’s blaze its day
May brighter, fairer be.O Light, that followest all my way,
I yield my flickering torch to Thee;
My heart restores its borrowed ray,That in Thine ocean depths its flow
May richer, fuller be.O Love, that wilt not let me go,
I rest my weary soul in Thee;
I give Thee back the life I owe,https://t.co/ySanqINBGPhttps://t.co/98cNnQSnqVWere there Turnip Trucks there that you fell off of? lol https://t.co/DFSkht7oKqDo you and your family observe Lent?https://t.co/un10lo4SQthttps://t.co/K5FfFCHxvyhttps://t.co/AHorw7irNGhttps://t.co/EcsI3B4gvfhttps://t.co/FgmcsVtB6Lhttps://t.co/PZ7ekRSKxq@SylviaRonnau DM'd youRT @DrShannonWarden: Dwelling on what's true &amp; praiseworthy (Phil 4:8) helps us grow healthy self-esteem.

He has numbered me my years
And someday He’ll take me yonder
Where there’ll be no pain or tears.There’s a great eternal purpose
In the life of everyone
And someday, we’ll know it’s meaning
When our days on earth are done.Higher hands are leading me
Higher hands are leading me
I am not alone, I know
As I walk this world below
For higher hands are leading me.New Song:
Though it seems I’m oft unnoticed
And lost in time &amp; space
God above is watching o’er me
Though I cannot see His face.It's a song, Leslie. https://t.co/CzWwzWeMNeAround the same time for me, too. https://t.co/XlvPLLkZsZNot mine....old Maranatha songs. https://t.co/79d6KwhSEWThou hast shown me the path of life
Thou hast shown me joy
In Thy presence is fullness of joy
At Thy right hand there r pleasures forevermorOther wells have all run dry,
But one spring's flowing still.
Thank you, God, for asking me
To come and drink my fill.Some have tasted dark despair,
And some cried salty tears.
Some have reaped the harvest of
Too many selfish years.Should I join their search or be
Content with what I've found?
Thanking God for peace of mind
And raise my grateful sound.People searching everywhere,
Just tryin' to find themselves.
Souvenirs of good old days
Lie dusty on their shelves.The Father spoke, the demons died... 
How could you have been so blind?There's no time to change your mind 
The Son has come and you've been left behind!Two men walking up a hill 
One disappears and one's left standing still 
I wish we'd all been ready.A man and wife asleep in bed
She hears a noise and turns her head he's gone 
I wish we'd all been readyThere's no time to change your mind 
The Son has come and you've been left behindChildren died the days grew cold 
A piece of bread could buy a bag of gold 
I wish we'd all been ready.Life was filled with guns and war 
And all of us got trampled on the floor 
I wish we'd all been ready...HE'S EVERYTHING TO ME!That lived a way out there and 
Now He walks beside me day by day, 
Ever watching o'er me lest I stray, 
Helping me to find that narrow way,Till by faith I met Him face to face 
And I felt the wonder of His grace, 
Then I knew that He was more than just a 
God who didn't care,I will celebrate Nativity, 
For it has a place in history, 
Sure, He came to set His people free, 
What is that to me?In the stars His handiwork I see, 
On the wind He speaks with majesty, 
Though He ruleth over land and sea, 
What is that to me?RT @thegoodbookusa: Do you have a framework for understanding the larger story? @randydnewman https://t.co/BzgwNGEuaRRT @thegoodbookusa: "Without a battle there can be no victory" https://t.co/ACgIEmCsNbAnd leave you to the treasures of your heart.
--John OxenhamChrist stands without your door &amp; gently knocks,
But if your gold or swine the entrance blocks, 
He forces no man's hold,
He will depart..The Christ went sadly: 
He had wrought for them a sign
Of love and tenderness divine—
They wanted swine!Oh get Thee gone, Omnipotence, 
And take this fool of Thine!

He's here in plain view.
Take a look, open your eyes,
He'll show it to you.You've seen Jesus my Lord..Have you ever stood with your family
With the Lord there in your midst
Seen the face of Christ on each other?

And claim the crown, through Christ my own.No condemnation now I dread;
Jesus, and all in Him is mine!
Alive in Him, my living Head,
And clothed in righteousness divine,My chains fell off, my heart was free;
I rose, went forth and followed Thee!Long my imprisoned spirit lay
Fast bound in sin &amp; nature's night;
Thine eye diffused a quick'ning ray,
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light'Tis mercy all, immense and free;
For, O my God, it found out me.He left His Father's throne above,
So free, so infinite His grace;
Emptied Himself of all but love,
And bled for Adam's helpless race;'Tis mercy all! let earth adore,
Let angel minds inquire no more.Tis mystery all! Th'Immortal dies!
Who can explore His strange design?
In vain the firstborn seraph tries
To sound the depths of love divineAmazing love! how can it be
That Thou, my God, should die for me?And can it be that I should gain
An int'rest in the Savior's blood?
Died He for me, who caused His pain?
For me, who Him to death pursued?Changed from glory into glory, 
Till in heaven we take our place, 
Till we cast our crowns before Thee, 
Lost in wonder, love, and praise.Finish, then, Thy new creation; 
Pure and spotless let us be. 
Let us see Thy great salvation 
Perfectly restored in Thee;Thee we would be always blessing, 
Serve Thee as Thy hosts above, 
Pray and praise Thee without ceasing, 
Glory in Thy perfect love.Come, Almighty to deliver, 
Let us all thy life receive; 
Suddenly return and never, 
Nevermore Thy temples leave.Take away our bent to sinning; 
Alpha and Omega be; 
End of faith, as its beginning, 
Set our hearts at liberty.Breathe, O breathe Thy loving Spirit 
Into every troubled breast! 
Let us all in Thee inherit; 
Let us find that second rest.Jesus Thou art all compassion, 
Pure, unbounded love Thou art; 
Visit us with Thy salvation; 
Enter every trembling heart.Love divine, all loves excelling, 
joy of heaven, to earth come down; 
fix in us Thy humble dwelling; 
all Thy faithful mercies crown!Surely Thy sweet and wondrous love
  Shall measure all my days;
And as it never shall remove,
  So neither shall my praise.Nay, Thou dost make me sit and dine,
   Ev’n in my enemies sight:
My head with oyl, my cup with wine
   Runnes over day and night.Yea, in deaths shadie black abode
   Well may I walk, not fear:
For Thou art with me; and Thy rod
    To guide, Thy staff to bear.Or if I stray, He doth convert
   And bring my minde in frame:
And all this not for my desert,
   But for His holy name.He leads me to the tender grasse,
  Where I both feed and rest;
Then to the streams that gently passe:
  In both I have the best.The God of love my shepherd is,
   And He that doth me feed:
While He is mine, and I am His,

Holds in view the conqueror’s crown:He has washed us with His blood,

affect our morality? #MouncechatQ9 Justice, another virtue, is about being fair. Can we be just and
merciful? Was God? @MouncechatQ8 Prudence, a “cardinal” (pivotal) moral virtue, is about wisely using your heart
and head. Why is it so important? #Mouncechat@unevereverno Best answer I've heard in a long time. Thanks, Bill #Mouncechat@preacherman_116 SO TRUE, and SO hard for young people to see. #MouncechatQ6 What are some things wrong with the statement, “It can’t be wrong if it doesn’t

idealism.” Do you? Why? #Mouncechat@DrShannonWarden Sorry about your accident. We'll miss you.

Alexander MacLarenFor Christmas I received a.....bad head cold..  🤧Only he who can say, "The Lord is the strength of my life" can say, "Of whom shall I be afraid?"
Alexander MacLarenHumility is a strange flower; it grows best in winter weather, and under storms of affliction.
Samuel RutherfordThere are two ways to read Scripture--the way a lawyer reads a will and the way an heir reads a will.
Alexander WhytePeace comes not from the absence of trouble, but from the presence of God.
Alexander MacLarenNever throw mud. You may miss the mark, and you'll have dirty hands.
Joseph ParkerSpeak to the suffering, and you will never lack an audience. There is a broken heart in every crowd.
Joseph ParkerEvery virtue divorced from thankfulness is maimed and limps along the spiritual road.
