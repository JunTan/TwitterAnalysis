I have been getting a lot of queries.
Leave me alone. It's not my fault!I have a thing about Private Schools. They didn't prepare me for the real world. Elitist &amp; divisive, they prey on the gullibility of parentsPrivate Schooling is protecting your child from the real world. Like an 'Excluding Sheltered Workshop' for the rich &amp; snobby. Nationalise!!I went to a Private School. Now I think that an @AustralianLabor Government should nationalise them all. Level the playing field &amp; why not?Last Thursday I went to my first AFL game. Swans v Hawthorn. I loved playing Rugby for my old school but now I love AFL and the SWANS more!!Beautiful work https://t.co/7AoIMpBQQOA product of this system. I knew no none outside my religious group. 
I was denied a holistic  education.
My parents paid big money for thisAll Private Schools bleed the taxpayers to promote and profit their exclusion policies. Parasitic &amp; divisive in Multicultural Australia!Private Schools: If students fail/cause trouble etc they are asked to leave. They become the responsibility of the Public School System.Private Schools: It's not what the school does for the student, it's what the student does for the school.
