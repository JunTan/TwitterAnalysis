I know people who've struggled with weight their entire life! Tried every diet etc etc@McDeirdree When you see someone smoking you know that's it's bad for them, but you can't know what someone's overall diet is like!@McDeirdree Yeah but the point is what people eat is between them and their doctor!@McDeirdree Yeah but again its about your own body! I know lots of larger girls who eat well and exercise!@McDeirdree It's the us against them mentality! But fat people deal with so much more shit than skinny people!@McDeirdree Yes but its more of a defensive response to being told how they should look! Skinny shaming is a by product of fat shaming!@McDeirdree When women (and men!) Feel more confident in themselves they take steps to take care of themselves!@McDeirdree But I think ireland as a nation needs to focus more on mental health than physical in a way. There's no budget for mental health@McDeirdree If larger women felt comfortable in their own skin they wouldn't feel the need to insult more priveledged women.@McDeirdree Its a classic response larger people have to feel better about themselves "only dogs like bones" etc. Etc.@McDeirdree its when she implies that the reason for it should be to make yourself more attractive to men that I find kind of gross!@McDeirdree Society bullies fat people not you specifically! And she's not saying "go out and buy a pack of tayto" but love yourself!@McDeirdree Also I know tons of size eights who eat nothing but rubbish and lots of size 16s who take care of themselves!@McDeirdree It does if we constantly tell people they're "socially unacceptable" because they're fat! It's their own business!@McDeirdree yeah but you can't bully individuals about their size either! Initiatives in schools would target it on a national level!@McDeirdree Yeah but there's no point starving yourself until you're thin if you've spent your life hating your body!@McDeirdree instead of concern over an individual's size and health, it would be more productive to have a good PE curriculum or something!@McDeirdree She's saying that you don't have to be thin to love yourself, though calling women "skinny bitches" isn't very body positive.@McDeirdree Honestly it's more the skinny shaming that I'd be concerned about.
