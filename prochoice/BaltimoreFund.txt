Would you be willing to partner on a fundraiser for us?Thanks to @CouncilmanKB @marypatclarke @ElectRyanDorsey @bmorebill for your leadership. We look forward to continuing to support this effortNot all people who need abortions are women, but low wage work disproportionately affects women of color, the majority of our patientsWe strongly support the Council‚Äôs efforts and urge removal of amendments excepting young ppl under 21, ppl w/ disabilities &amp; tipped workersWe know that low wages make families choose between rent, groceries, school supplies and paying for health care. That‚Äôs unacceptable.As a reminder: we serve low income people in Baltimore who cannot afford the cost of their abortions.Unfortunately, because the hearing was so packed, we were not able to present oral testimony.We headed to City Hall tonight to offer written testimony on the proposal to raise the minimum wage in Baltimore City to $15.Join us for our third bowl-a-thon and help us raise $25k for abortion access in MD. https://t.co/Eq6DEUCawbSending love, solidarity &amp; a little $ to our friends at @NolaAbortionFund today.
