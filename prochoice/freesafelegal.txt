Laffoy winding up the session."But I will not take the choice away from any woman. "I love my daughter but I am pro-choice."Speaker has a child with disabilities and found today offensive, pro-choice people still care for children with disabilitiesNo, it’s the woman’s choice, her will and what she wants to doQ7 - AI "Is there a circumstance where you believe that there is no justification for an abortion?"Irish legislature to legislate in the best interests of all Irish citizens?"Q6 - for Rev. Burroughs "Would I be right in concluding that the CofI has the utmost confidence in theBishops do not mention destiny or rights of the woman involved.Bishops: There are difficult situations, but the child has his or her own destiny and "right to life"into challenging circumstances, would parents of those babies not be right to opt for an abortion?"Q5 - for the Bishops again "U say the 8th has protected lives. What about those babies lives after they were born, especially those bornChurch provides practical assistance to women who have crisis pregnancies – Yes but Cura does not give abortion as an option.practical suggestions do you have for these women?"We have heard directly from some of these women and their journey is expensive and degrading so whatQ4 - Irish Catholic Bishops "If the 8th is retained thousands of women will still have a need to travel to the UK.... It is not part of catholic doctrine that women must continue with pregnancy if baby has died.Bishop Brendan Leahy: both life of the "mother and child” must be protected...to proceed with a pregnancy when the baby has died in the womb"Q3 - Bishops "When did the catholic church position change with regard to where a woman hasBishop Brendan Leahy: In the current constitution we protect both the life of the "baby and the mother". Again we don't, women have died,This proves difficult to believe given the track record of the RCC in Irelandamendment is this consistent with democratic society if a ref is not held"Q2 -"if majority of Irish citizens of child bearing age have not had opportunity to have a say in 8thBishop Brendan Leahy says he hangs his head in shame but wants to promote a culture that cares for life now.Rep from Catholic Bishops says she was also upset by this: "Did I want to be here and speak to this question?"to recent discovery of #tuambabies Speaker also says she herself is from Tuam. Wants to know how they correlate the two realities.consensual or not, how can the church expect us to go along with this with the church's record in particular with regardQ1 - Irish Catholoic Bishops "Prolife groups would insist every life matters regardless of FFA or how woman was impregnated,Bishop Brendan Leahy, @JaneDonnelly20 and Rev Gililan Morton are the extra speakers for the questions portion.Now to the questions portion of the session."We know u are faced with issues not just about personhood, but also wat in a society like this is properly the place of constitutional law"Feels "nuanced legislation" would more suitably address medically necessary abortion. Hopes "rights of mother &amp; unborn may be duly balanced"Refers to failings of the 8th that CofI predicted in 83 caused by putting it in the constitution.not precise wording there sorry"This is but an interim and preliminary comment" 

"CofI (thinks) abortion should be confined to distinct medical necessity" -Says they have a great tradition of parliamentary government and they view it more as a matter for legislation than constitutional law.Explaining the function of the synod "Large number of people both clergy and lay people who meet""It's hard in the Church of Ireland for us to explain what we actually think"Says he doesn't claim "any superior authority because we come from a faith backround"Now Rev. Michael Burroughs who starts with saying his submission will be brief.She finishes with "Please do not allow that to happen""Anything less than full repeal will simply result in us having to return to this over &amp; over &amp; will result in anotherhigh profile tragedy.""The constitution is not the place to deal with a healthcare issue."

"The 8th should be repealed not replaced""Regardless of how individuals arrive at their own moral view on abortion access to abortion is a healthcare issue""The humanity of each woman must be recognised." "She cannot be devalued as a mere vessel or incubator"Now talking on personhood. A woman "loves and is loved, she has people in her life who rely on her"Talks of Iona being registered as  charity for the advancement of religion.

There is even less support for the idea that abortion should be illegal or"The Irish state talks as if it were a settled moral value that abortion should be illegal""No-one (who disagrees with abortion) should ever be pressured into an abortion""Secular morality is evidence based..involves emphasis on reduction in harm and increase in well being."RT @anyciar: Historically RCC does not recognise miscarried/stillborn babies. They did not deserve funerals or be buried in consecrated gro…"Religious based morality comes from dogma in holy books...there are 126 different religions in Ireland""The current Irish abortion law does not respect freedom of conscience.""They do not have the right to impose those religious views on women who do not share those values".@atheistie apologies, @AshlingOBrien2Listing religious organisations campaigning for the 8th in 83."There is no doubt that the 8th amendment is religiously inspired" - speaks now to the history of the campaign for the 8th in 83Talking about the org, part of @repealeight and states they are prochoice. "Faith is only one way in which ppl form ethics &amp; morality"Abortion is often needed to save the life of a pregnant woman @CatholicBishops ignore this.Moving now to speaker from @atheistie @ashlingobrien22"Mother is entitled to best possible pastoral care" after a miscarriageThis is claim every anti-choice group has made so far. Women have died as a direct result of the 8th Amendment."Abortion is not a medical treatment" says speaker on behalf of the Catholic Bishops of Ireland."Catholic church has never thought that life of unborn should be preferred to right to life of mother" refers to notion of double intent now"number of aspects of 40.3.3 that we ask you to consider.
It does not place the right to life of the unborn above the right of the mother""Such an outcome would almost certainly result if we remove (the 8th) from our constitution)""We have seen what this can tragically lead to what this can lead to in our past"Talking now about the perspective as a christian, that this "requires that we recognise that god the creator made each of us"Says these claims are based on human rights, best available evidence and compassion."We cannot support the suggestion that one person can decide when it is the time for another person to die""Some people argue that the right to life should be a matter of personal choice, the woman's choice"She says "being prolife does not end once a child is born."recommended on screen during the recorded voice testimonies played yesterday.Speaking to serious medical conditions discovered in pregnancy. References their organisation CURA, who are part of the list that was.@CatholicBishops seem to be forgetting there is a woman's body at the centre of a pregnancy, wanted or unwanted.Says they arent trying 2 "romanticise pregnancy" &amp; that they dont wish to say that "all pregnancies are experienced in exactly the same way"Emphasis here seems to be on welcomed pregnancies, terminology use. Now going through broad strokes of foetal development.References Beyoncé's "twin babies and not unborn feotuses""Most of us have heard at some point the good news of announcements of pregnancy in our own circles""We understand that the child is not an extension of the mother"Talks of modern culture's value on individual rights. "That is good"Draws attention to their submission. "I would like to offer three perspectives for your consideration"Thanking Justice Laffoy for the invite.

Claims she was not given a choiceThe person who asked the question asks for it to be repeated as it was not answered "Where and when are women being pressured?"Q7 speaker clarifying "I repeat the question - by whom and where"Cora says women given diagnosis of FFA in UK and immediately offered a termination there and then. This is highly unlikely.is this happening and what role does the 8th play on this pressure?"Cora claims number of women expressing regret has risen. However the majority of women do not regret their abortion https://t.co/XBWJirayUsQ7 - for PLC "You mentioned that mothers are being put under pressure to seek abortions in some circumstances. By who and where.@ailbhes We have abortion in Ireland, we just export it.@ailbhes In poorer countries where contraception is not available abortion rates have stayed the same.@ailbhes Overall globally, in developed countries abortion rates have been declining (due to access to contraception etc).@ailbhes re-iterates what @Colmogorman says. Also says difficult to say what "floodgates" are , as women already travel to UK..@Colmogorman no evidence to suggest Ireland has lower abortion rate than other countries..@Colmogorman says he will stick to the question actually asked. All evidence says the opposite, liberal abortion laws = lower abortion rateLaffoy says every member of the panel will get a chance to answer this question.RT @freesafelegal: Cora mentions PLC actuarial report. This report didn't cite any reputable sources.Cora mentions PLC actuarial report. This report didn't cite any reputable sources.Laffoy asks for answers to be brief.Q6 - for panel "What evidence is there that the floodgates to abortion would open if the 8th amendment was repealed"Sorry, for 1937 constitution that is.Laffoy asks for a show of hands of anyone who would have been of voting age for property rightsSteen says we should help women who travel for abortions. Criminalizing them and shaming them is not helping.Property rights and reproductive rights are very different, disingenuous of Steen to compare themSteen says we haven't had a chance to vote on property rights eithermean you think anyone not alive or not eligible to vote in 83 isn't entitled to a say in this issue"Q5 - for maria steen "in your paper u say there is no genuine reason to vote on this issue. Does this notthat women in a crisis pregnancy are therefore the vulnerable in society"is it not marginalised women living in poverty. To hope this is relieved seems idealistic. Would you not therefore considerQ4 to Iona "U frequently refer to vulnerable in society, that majority shld make decisions to protect this minority.

You cannot be a pro-life feminist https://t.co/frywRGd7Kqof your presentations, please give us access to those"who currently are the minority being persecuted.
Also point for PLC - reference to congressional reports aren't in the footnotes...Q3 to Iona - What do you say to the idea that if 8th was repealed then power of choice would be given to mothers #citizensassemblyWe obviously completely agree that children with disabilities + their families must be supported, this is not at odds with being pro-choicePLC simultaneously presenting Ireland as leading healthcare provider while also claiming patients are pressuredNeither reps from the Pro-Life Campaign have directly answered the question asked here.We really recommend this article from @linneadunne of @parents_4choice on the issue: https://t.co/I7MlnF87VX #citizensassemblyWe have addressed the issue of DS an number of times so far today, really society's attitude to DS has very little to do with abortionfree country - is that stated government policy or is that just a reference to a newspaper"?Q2 for Cora - "In your presention you made ref to DS, increased cases of "excuse" for abortions.

She talks of victims of violence and ofSmyth references migrant women who suffer because of strict travel restrictions, references the arrest and return to Ireland of Ms. Y"Women can find themselves caught in a spiral of poverty and inequality"

"That smacks of one law for the rich and one law for the poor""If you borrow you risk running into crippling financial debt. And if you take the abortion pill you risk criminal prosecution"Thanks to @ailbhes for the shoutout to our and @TFMRIRE's submission. Neither of us were invited to present today."the abortion ban hits poor, marginalised and vulnerable women"Smyth directs the assembly to submissions from ARC and @tfmr asks what of the women who cannot travel?"Abortion is still stigmatised...but we no longer behave as if it never happens" says Smyth, referencing those who self administer at homeSmith references #marref as a powerful demonstration of change in Ireland, "how we value equality and want to do right by people""We can't end the violation of women's humans rights and freedoms as long as the 8th amendment remains in our constitution""A history all to shamefully affirmed by the finding of a mass grave...we're good at burying the truth" #tuambabies"Women and girls were severely punished for becoming pregnant outside marriage...vulnerable women were abandoned by their families""The historical treatment of women in Ireland, unmarried women and their babies, is not something we're proud of"We have no friends in high places, we advocate for FREE, safe legal abortion, not abortion for profit."We believe that the 8th amendment should be repealed in its entirety...in order to respect womens' lives, heath and choices"Starts by telling us what the coalition is "An alliance formed after PLDPA...we are now 85 organisations representing about 1.5 million ppl"This is plainly false. Women have died due to the 8th Amendment.Now we have @ailbhes from @repealeight #citizensassembly"Article 40.3.3 protects the lives of both mother and child" claims Steen, finishes by saying "we can value both lives"It's disingenuous to compare UK statistics to Ireland. We are a completely different countries with different cultures and populations."Our Irish constitution is a beacon of hope that elevates choice over justice"Steen from Iona Institute, which favours #baptismbarrier and opposed #marref making multiple references to "discrimination"Steen continuing to refer to UK abortion statistics.An infant is a young child or baby, absolutely no-one is advocating for this. A disgraceful statement. #citizensassemblyRefers to "abandoning our mother, sisters and daughters" to have abortions..."Repeal means a culture where abortions were normalised" - refers to repeat abortionsSteen claims "Repeal means killing an infant for profit" an OUTRAGEOUS accusation."Repeal means adopting a culture where it is ok to adopt a baby because he has a cleft palate" - refers to UK statsSteen making implications on funding, profit of abortion and reference to "friends in high places""Most people see the importance of establishing norms that value each life as equal"Claims abortion is a punishment "for crimes of father" and refers to the concept of "natural death"In fact #repealthe8th is a first step in GIVING human rights to women and pregnant people in Ireland."Repeal means repealing human rights" claims Steen. Refers to "discrimination" of abortion.Steen claims removing the 8th is removing a fundamental human right. Claims the 8th is the only protection of a minority.Steen says "rights, needs and dignity" of both are accommodated, protected under the 8th.Steen says the 8th protects a minority and says it "acknowledges the equal value of each life" and "does not pit one against the other"Everything Steen is saying could easily be applied to women in Ireland, our human rights are restricted because of the vote of the majority."It is wrong even though a majority may wish to do it. Where it breaches a fundamental human right in the constitution...""From time to time a majority can be put together to do things to a minority that the minority might not like""In a democracy the majority is allowed to make the rules."Steen says she will explain why a referendum, in this particular circumstance, is wrong and refers to "cultural change"Great factual presentation by @Colmogorman providing real and realistic solutions #citizensassembly #repealthe8thSteen says she wants to address the question "why shouldn't we simply have a vote on this issue" #citizensassemblyNow we have Maria Steen of IonaLaws must "respect, protect and fulfill the rights of women and girls in Ireland"AI recommends that the 8th be repealed, not replaced.O'Gorman references #magdalenlaundaries and Mother and Baby homes #tuambabies #citizensassembly"They must make a timely referral to another professional...but conscientious objection" must be practical and consider an emergency"Legislating on the grounds of sexual violence is a complex issue" often delays or denies access forcing women to "prove" assault."There must be flexibility to ensure that women's rights are protected later in pregnancy"Must be provided on minimum grounds in later stages also says O'Gorman"This is common sense. Access must be practical, not an obstacle course" says O'Gorman of on request access in first trimester"International human rights standards are evolving to recommend access to abortion on request""If we don't fully decriminalise abortion the chilling effect on doctors will remain"O'Gorman now talks of the treatment of Ms. Y, forced to undergo "a major surgical procedure against her will"PLDPA provides no practical assistance, quotes Rhona Mahony "forces doctors to play medical roulette"Laws "deter health professionals" - the chilling effect.O'Gorman refers to 14 year jail sentence and prosecutions in NI.Human rights compliant abortion laws ensure "safe and timely access to abortion both in law and in practice""68% believe we need to trust women when they say they need an abortion""Our RedC polling found 82% of people who consider themselves religious do not want their religious views imposed on others"O'Gorman points out that restricting access does not reduce abortion, it increases unsafe and illegal abortion."Right to life provisions only apply after birth."

"Abortions will always be needed"

"Abortion bans do not stop abortions""International law does not apply before birth"O'Gorman refers to "minimum grounds" of rape, FFA and incest."They have a right to control their own fertility" "when such pregnancies occur ensure they have access to a range of choices""Women and girls have a human right to access safe and legal abortions"On international law - "They are not imposed on Ireland by the UN or amnesty...or anyone else"He speaks on the @AmnestyIreland policy on what Irish legislation should include."The overwhelming majority want increased access to abortion"It "severely limits...consent"Report documented "harrowing experience of women and girls in Ireland" "We found that the 8th amendment was the root cause"Colm speaking of the research into countries prohibiting abortion access.Now to @Colmogorman speaking on behalf of @AmnestyIreland #citizensassembly"Without the right to life, all other rights are meaningless" Sherlock finishes.We know this is nonsense, every single TV show that mentions abortion has had a rep from the pro-life movement.Refers to Ireland's record as a maternal healthcare provider."Our abortion rates are only a fraction of those in Britain"Speaks of those who are homeless during pregnancy, of perinatal palliative care and of improving services for DS.Cora is speaking to a lot of anecdotes and personal stories but they don't reflect reality nor are they backed up by studies + statisticsSays "instead we should be building on the life affirming vision at the heart of the 8th amendment"Sherlock now talking about "one sided coverage" by the media on #repealthe8th #citizensassembly.Speaks of a woman who died by suicide after an abortion whose suicide note "directly referenced her abortion"."Women contemplating abortion are told their unborn babies is nothing more than a clump of cells" - SherlockThis was already discussed by @parents_4Choice who feel their children with DS are used by pro-life movement.Sherlock speaks of the Planned Parenthood story.Speaks of some who experienced complications following abortion in the UK."Abortion is the ultimate discrimination" says SherlockSpeaks about "target" of those with DS.Sherlock speaks of pressure which PLC says will exist without the presence of the 8th amendment.Sherlock speaking of Sinéad McBreen "we were pressured to abort Grace"Says the requirement to book a trip to England forced them to wait and consider the decision.Tells of Mary Kenny "I know many people who owe the life of their child to the 8th amendment"Sherlock speaking of individual stories.Cora Sherlock - "responsibility we all have to not add to any pain or anguish they may be experiencing"Mary Laffoy introducing the first speaker, Cora Sherlock of Pro Life CampaignRT @OrlaGleans: ARC are live tweeting the #citizensassembly procceeding today https://t.co/1b56tSlVorRT @CiaraFeeney: @freesafelegal @parents_4choice I do.

Ours is here: https://t.co/jxa38wqZlG.@parents_4choice It is an insult to them and their families..@parents_4choice "Shay is treated as a second class citizen" This parent feels kids with DS have been used by the pro-life campaign..@sineadredmond reads a submission from member of @parents_4choice who has a child with Downs SyndromeQ10: To Family and Life @bpas1968 is a non profit registered charity.F&amp;L agree, thank Citizens for inviting them.Q8: Do Family and Life respect that those asked to present were requested by the Citizens in the room today?Family and Life speak to their work "overseas" in response.Person who asked the question responds: Is it fair to say Family and Life is more of a "pro-birth" org than a "pro-life" org? Great questionF&amp;A try to claim that the "easy decision" for governments is to "get rid of disabled children" which they object toFamily and Life are aware of problems, these are practical problems that can be solved by TDs etcQ8 for Family and Life, what work do F&amp;A do to help families with disabled children etc?Q7: Comment from table 5, @bpas1968 had a large income but their expenditure was actually larger.Every Life Counts agrees, we need more support for these families and state should support them.Q6: Parents with children with disabilities are not supported once the child is actually born. For Every Life Counts.@IrishFPA the decisions of family's and women must be respected in this context.Q5: Any problem with following the likes of Denmark who seem to be following a "eugenics policy"? for @IrishFPALaw already prevents doctors from pressuring women into abortions here.We believe as long as there is good regulation of abortion services when introduced here this is very unlikely to happen.Every Life Counts claim children with disabilities are dehumanised by liberal abortion laws and parents are pressured.Q4: Does Every Life Counts believe if the 8th is repealed women will be mandated to terminate their pregnancy?Family and Life struggle with this question, say @bpas1968 are in the "abortion industry" but don't answer the specific questionQ3: again to Family and Life how could @bpas1968 have a vested interest in a business sense if they will lose the "business" of Irish women?Family and Life say again that the "benefits" of the 8th have not been outlined to CAQ2: for Family and Life, what about those with pro-life perspectives who presented, do they not also have a vested interest?.@sineadredmond hesitates to use that term but women's choices are very restricted because of the 8th.Q1: 50% of women have procedures preformed on them without consent. Are docs and nurses performing medical negligence?We now move on to Q&amp;A, some supporting members from the groups who presented will join for this section.They invited speakers from @bpas1968 as they had experience with Irish women. The Citizens applaud Judge Laffoy's response.Judge Laffoy is now defending #CitizensAssembly record in response to Family and Life criticisms.

The question is do we want it to be safe and legal. @RuthCoppingerTD #vinbSociety and the state need to support disabled people and their families better. #vinbWe need FREE safe and legal abortion access, not everyone can afford to travel or purchase pills. #vinb"I fundamentally believe we should trust women with their own health" #vinbFFA and disability are NOT the same.

Keep on having chats. #Chats #repealthe8thThe term "bodily autonomy" is the most basic human right- it's what the 8th amendment has taken from us. #repealthe8thConsider the 8th in an intersectional way: it affects people in so many more ways than language has led us to believe. #repealthe8thThe more a person is educated on what the 8th actually IS, the more pro-choice they become. Don't underestimate the power of conversation!The desire for Free, Safe, Legal choice is right down the middle moderate. We need a full spectrum of options for all people. #repealthe8th"It's worrying that law might be shaped around one person's belief about when life begins. It should be about the pregnant person's belief."Abortion is a moral choice for the person who has the pregnancy, no one else. #repealthe8th"You're pro-choice if you wouldn't stand in the way of someone else accessing abortion." @TaraFlynn #repealthe8th.@TaraFlynn "There are so many of us.
