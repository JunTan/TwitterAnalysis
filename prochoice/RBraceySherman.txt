That's cruel &amp; inhumane.When the parent when to the school administrators, they simply said to tell the student not to dress that way and they wouldn‚Äôt get peed on.I will never forget the email I received from a parent who said their kid was peed on by other students because of their gender identity.Trans students are on the receiving end of harassment in the bathroom at the hands of other students. We need to protect their access.Who thinks it‚Äôs okay to deny a child the right to go to the bathroom? Cruel, horrible people.Trans students also shouldn‚Äôt have to hold their pee all day long because they can‚Äôt use the bathroom of their gender identity. That‚Äôs cruelTrans students miss so much school because they‚Äôre terrified to go because of harassment and bullying. Our govt should be supporting them.No one should be denied an education. No one should be bullied, incl while they‚Äôre trying to learn. This is not a state's rights issue.Trans students are disproportionately harmed by their peers, especially trans students of color. This is a civil rights issue.Everyone deserves a safe space to learn. I mean EVERYONE.I used to work at @GSANetwork. The stories I heard from students about the terror they faced at the hands of their classmates was horrific.If you‚Äôre angry about this &amp; want to support orgs doing amazing work on trans student rights, donate to @GSANetwork, @transstudent &amp; @GLSEN.TRANS STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE EVERY RIGHT THAT CIS STUDENTS HAVE, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO USE THE BATHROOM AND SAFE ACCESS TO EDUCATION.

What they say their rally is (Obama 2009): https://t.co/I3I0aD0z99
Reality:https://t.co/YS7RnH6rKU #MarchOfLiesAll that to say, our government used #alternativefacts to basically end abortion access &amp; they‚Äôre going to do it to everything #MarchForLiesFACT: All of your White historical heroes were racist, including the women like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. #MarchOfLiesDid Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony do amazing things for women? Yep. They were racist too. People are complex. #MarchOfLiesElizabeth Cady Stanton said, "We educated, virtuous white women are more worthy of the vote."
https://t.co/uiO8wWA1ft #MarchOfLiesToo bad their org is named after Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who was an abolitionist, but stopped at full equality for Black folks. #MarchOfLiesYou know that Stanton Health org that doesn‚Äôt provide birth control? They want to eradicate PP.
https://t.co/xAyMGe9yKD
#MarchOfLiesSo, why isn't Susan B. Anthony List isn‚Äôt called out for naming their org after a complicated &amp; racist woman, just like Sanger? #MarchOfLiesSusan B Anthony said she‚Äôd cut off her right arm before fighting for the right to vote for Black folks.
https://t.co/oUVwFfv6e7 #MarchOfLiesSusan B. Anthony refused to let Black suffragettes like Ida B. Wells march with white women for the right to vote. #MarchOfLiesSusan B. Anthony List is named after the suffragette, of course. They fail to acknowledge that she was famously racist! #MarchOfLiesOh, and one other thing about Sanger ‚Äî anti-choice folks love to call her racist, yet say nothing about Susan B. Anthony List.
#MarchOfLiesWe have to put medical science and peer reviewed research FIRST when creating policy. Not ideology. #MarchOfLies#AlternativeFacts isn‚Äôt just a funny meme. It‚Äôs dangerous. It‚Äôs how abortion rights have been eroded across this nation. #MarchOfLiesWe certainly shouldn‚Äôt allow our tax dollars to fund health centers without medical staff who peddle #alternativefacts. #MarchOfLiesNo one should be denied healthcare or choice of health center because they‚Äôre poor. Healthcare is a human right. #MarchOfLiesIf ppl want to go there for care, that‚Äôs up to them. It‚Äôs not OK govt denying ppl with low-incomes the choice of clinic. #MarchOfLiesYou can read the article here: https://t.co/xAyMGe9yKD @Cosmopolitan @robinmarty #MarchOfLiesFor @Cosmopolitan @robinmarty interviewed Stanton Health a ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs health center‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt offer birth control or abortion #MarchOfLiesNow, a few do provide medical care, however, not the full range of reprohealth care people need. Ex. https://t.co/xAyMGe9yKD #MarchOfLiesWhat does that mean? It means your tax dollars are being sent to organizations with no medical training  to give medical advice #MarchOfLiesWhat anti-choice politicians have been doing in states for years is handing the Title X budget to anti-choice orgs. 
#MarchOfLiesBut someone who is scared, might not know they‚Äôre lying. And as POTUS puts gag orders on science, it‚Äôll be harder to find info.
#MarchOfLiesThey say that you‚Äôll get breast cancer from abortion, depression, etc. All things that are easily provable with data. #MarchOfLiesIn several states, your tax dollars are being funneled to centers where people are legally allowed to lie about medical info. #MarchOfLiesI asked them about birth control, and they told me all of it wasn‚Äôt effective and condoms were useless.
#MarchOfLies2nd CPC I visited, wouldn‚Äôt show me the preg test for 30 min saying it wasn‚Äôt ready, until I said I wouldn‚Äôt have an abortion. #MarchOfLiesThey offer ultrasounds &amp; pregnancy tests, &amp; dress as doctors, but they‚Äôre all non-medical volunteers with no training.
#MarchOfLiesI‚Äôve been to 2 CPCs. They‚Äôre awful. They lock you in a room &amp; won‚Äôt let you out until you promise you won‚Äôt have an abortion. #MarchOfLiesCrisis Pregnancy Centers vastly outnumber abortion clinics. They set up next door to deceive people seeking abortions.
#MarchOfLiesOnce they defund PP, what they‚Äôre going to do, is give the money to Crisis Pregnancy Centers, aka NOT MEDICAL CENTERS.
#MarchOfLiesAnti-choice folks are hoping you won‚Äôt speak, when they defund PP, based on fake videos from last year &amp; lies about Sanger.
#MarchOfLiesBut this myth still persists &amp; it persists for a reason: If you don‚Äôt read the real history, you may not stand up for PP today. #MarchOfLiesAnd for me, Margaret Sanger died a long time ago and has nothing to do with the care @PPact gives today, &amp; I've received.
#MarchOfLiesBecause we live in a world of #alternativefacts, most people don‚Äôt know the true story of Sanger or dare to pick up a book.
#MarchOfLiesBack to Sanger: Context is key. She wanted Black folks to have access to healthcare &amp; Black doctors.‚Ä¶ https://t.co/RZpq1qrieMFor more on that, read @DorothyERoberts‚Äô book Killing The Black Body. Also follow everything she does. She‚Äôs brilliant.
#MarchOfLiesBlack women had no value unless they could produce kids for their slave owners. Once we weren‚Äôt slaves, we have too many kids.
#MarchOfLiesLiterally no one gave a fuck about Black women having too many pregnancies until after slavery &amp; they couldn‚Äôt profit.
#MarchOfLiesThings DuBois believed about Black folks ‚Äúbreeding carelessly‚Äù are things anti-choice folks say today.‚Ä¶ https://t.co/OOfTmKbXC7Now, DuBois was a great man, but also hella classist. A quote often attributed to Sanger, was his:‚Ä¶ https://t.co/vQGFeuLNADThey were focused on expanding healthcare, not ‚ÄúBlack genocide‚Äù as anti-choice #alternativefacts
claim. https://t.co/37h8z6VbgK
#MarchOfLiesDuBois &amp; Sanger‚Äôs idea was called ‚ÄúThe Negro Project‚Äù. They definitely needed better branding.
https://t.co/37h8z6VbgK
#MarchOfLiesBack then, many white doctors wouldn‚Äôt see Black patients. Sanger made sure Black folks had healthcare.
https://t.co/37h8z6VbgK
#MarchOfLiesWhy did Sanger open birth control clinics in Black communities? Because W.E.B. DuBois asked her to! https://t.co/37h8z6VbgK
#MarchOfLiesSanger actually opposed abortion. She has the exact same stance on abortion that Ben Carson does. https://t.co/ansVtPEG5Z
#MarchOfLiesWas Margaret Sanger racist? Most white folks are, even a little. Several POTUS owned humans &amp; they get to be on money.
#MarchOfLiesGuess what? When I decided to have an abortion, I didn‚Äôt think about Margaret. At all. #MarchOfLiesHer legacy is used to shame Black women like me from having an abortion. #MarchOfLiesLet‚Äôs start at the beginning: Margaret Sanger was a nurse and birth control advocate. She started PP 100 years ago. #MarchOfLiesFor homework: Everyone should read @AngryBlackLady‚Äôs @Rewire_News piece on Margaret Sanger: https://t.co/37h8z6VbgK #MarchOfLiesI guess that is easier than trying to look at the complexity of Margaret Sanger‚Äôs work &amp; reading her actual words, in context. #MarchOfLiesLots of anti-choice people like to cite Sanger, PP‚Äôs founder, as their reason for refusing to listen to actual Black women.
#MarchOfLiesAnyway, let‚Äôs get back to more lies and propaganda. The reality &amp; myth of Margaret Sanger.
#MarchOfLiesI wonder what Rosa would think of #MarchForLife endorsing a POTUS who cut the Violence Against Women Office. Hmm.
#MarchOfLiesRosa Parks knew that access to contraception &amp; abortion care were important to folks in domestic violence situations.
#MarchOfLiesAnti-choice folks love to pervert Rosa Parks‚Äô legacy too. Did you know she served on PP‚Äôs board &amp; fought domestic violence? #MarchOfLiesMiss Coretta on Margaret Sanger: "I would like to say that I am proud to be a woman tonight.‚Äù
https://t.co/kDZQW8SlId #MarchOfLiesDr. King‚Äôs wife, Miss Coretta, accepted the @PPact award on his behalf. You should read what she said: https://t.co/Zj2VWBH0Rz #MarchOfLiesStop reading memes and out of context Dr. King quotes &amp; perverting his legacy. Read his ACTUAL WORDS.
https://t.co/Zj2VWBH0Rz #MarchOfLiesDr. King also believed that family planning was an important part of economic security for Black folks.
https://t.co/Zj2VWBH0Rz #MarchOfLiesDr. King not only accepted the award from PP, he said it was among one of his most prized possessions.
https://t.co/Zj2VWBH0Rz #MarchOfLiesThe other day, a dude tweeted me a link of a meme with an anti-abortion quote supposedly from Dr. King. It was utter bullshit.
#MarchOfLiesAnti-choice is perverting Dr. King‚Äôs legacy for their agenda.
FACT: HE ACCEPTED AN AWARD FROM @PPact!
https://t.co/Zj2VWBH0Rz #MarchofLiesIf you‚Äôre wondering what we‚Äôre up against in an administration where facts don‚Äôt matter, look at what‚Äôs happened to abortion. #MarchOfLiesAbortion is the most misunderstood issue, healthcare and political, because of the absence of facts &amp; logic.
#MarchOfLiesWhenever you hear someone talking about this stuff ‚Äî ask them where they get their information. Most of it isn‚Äôt true.
#MarchOfLiesYet, the made up ‚Äúpost-abortion syndrome‚Äù is another reason they pass laws requiring waiting periods &amp; ‚Äúcounseling‚Äù.
#MarchOfLiesHave you heard of ‚Äúpost-abortion syndrome‚Äù? It‚Äôs a completely made up thing. COMPLETELY. MADE. UP.
https://t.co/yNlnDSoCDu #MarchOfLiesMany people think that your mental health is more likely to be in danger after an abortion. It‚Äôs simply not true. #MarchOfLiesAgain, #AlternativeFacts isn‚Äôt just a new meme. In abortion, it‚Äôs a way of life. They lie and lie, until people believe it.
#MarchOfLiesThey mandate this ‚Äúcounseling‚Äù before an abortion yet research shows ‚Öì of the info they spread is false #MarchOfLies
https://t.co/xqKYM9dY3IBut now because POTUS is putting gag orders on scientists, it‚Äôs harder to put actual medical information into the world.
#MarchOfLiesIt‚Äôs propaganda saying that abortions cause breast cancer even though NO STUDY SAYS THIS. 
https://t.co/NSCwh8eFCf
#MarchOfLiesCounseling isn‚Äôt a bad thing. I think our nation needs more. But what states are forcing isn‚Äôt counseling. It‚Äôs propaganda. #MarchOfLiesBecause of this lie, states pass waiting periods of 1-3 days, as if we haven‚Äôt thought about our decision to have an abortion.
#MarchOfLiesAnd because they believe this myth, they think we need state mandated counseling before an abortion. Lies impact policy.
#MarchOfLiesMany people believe most people regret their abortions. Actually, research shows that 95% don‚Äôt regret.
https://t.co/yNlnDSoCDu #MarchOfLiesYet, based on this myth, states require parental notification &amp; consent laws, ignoring data, and putting youth in danger.
#MarchForLiesOf teens who have abortions, most fear a family member hurting them or kicking them out for becoming pregnant.
#MarchForLies6% of abortions are obtained by 15-17 year olds. The majority are sought by folks in their 20s.
https://t.co/WBJVpRJKEQ
#MarchForLiesOnly 18% of people having abortions are teens. And our nation doesn‚Äôt support young parents. It kicks them out of school.
#MarchForLiesThere‚Äôs a myth that abortions are sought by teens &amp; one night stands. That‚Äôs wildly inaccurate. Also one night stands are OK.
#MarchForLiesMost people think that abortion is dangerous. It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs extremely safe. 14x safer than labor.
https://t.co/dEDNv3Qjv1
#MarchForLiesIf you silence people‚Äôs access to basic information &amp; make them question scientific fact, you can make them believe anything. #MarchForLiesI know #AlternativeFacts are a new concept to some folks, but those of us in the climate &amp; abortion movements are used to it. #MarchForLiesThey enter it into the Congressional record as if it‚Äôs legit facts, &amp; spread it confusing the public. Hence #alternativefacts.
#MarchForLiesThen, they take all this fake data &amp; journal articles and use it as ‚Äúevidence‚Äù to pass restrictive laws. #MarchForLiesAfter coming up with their fake data, which they can‚Äôt get published in reputable journals, they made their own journals. #MarchForLiesOrganizations like the Charlotte Lozier Institute pervert data from reputable orgs all the time. Ignoring context &amp; fact. #MarchForLiesOnce they denied access to government data &amp; research, the anti-choice orgs put out fake, non-peer reviewed data. #MarchForLiesThey also don‚Äôt want us studying the root causes to the need for abortion care, like poverty &amp; lack of access to contraception #MarchForLiesThey don‚Äôt want us to know FACTS, like a ‚Öì of cis women will have an abortion, they‚Äôre incredibly safe, &amp; why people have them #MarchForLiesFor decades, the government hasn‚Äôt allowed us to research abortion or gun-related deaths. They don‚Äôt want us to have data. #MarchForLiesRemember when, the other day, POTUS put a gag order on scientists? That‚Äôs so they can put out their own facts &amp; info. #MarchForLiesPatients should be able to go to their doctor for sound medical advice, not political ideology. That‚Äôs not healthcare. #MarchForLiesNot only is this a violation of their right to free speech, it interferes with the doctor-patient relationship. #MarchForLiesAbortion providers, who went to medical school &amp; know research, are forced to read statements made up by politicians. #MarchForLiesSo, you know how POTUS put a gag order on abortion globally &amp; on scientists? That‚Äôs also happened in so many states already. #MarchForLiesSpeaking of #MarchforLife actually being #MarchForLies ‚Äî let‚Äôs talk about what‚Äôs actually about to happen with our tax dollars.Will the #MarchForLife folks march against Trump‚Äôs plan to ban refugees? #MarchForLies
