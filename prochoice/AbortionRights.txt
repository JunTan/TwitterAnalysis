Keep up all your fabulous work!  #CAabortion@meimeian @MSFC Well, birth control and sterilization sometimes. Anything that stops babies or allows sex for pleasure only. #CAabortion@meimeian @MSFC Too bad. Training on abortion "ethics" probably gives way too much respect to anti-choice views #CAabortion@MSFC It's a good solution but carries danger of marginalizing abortion care. Schools could absolve themselves of responsiblty? #CAabortion@MSFC But doctors need to be champions for abortion access in their communities/local hospitals, which takes courage &amp; strength #CAabortion@MSFC A student could train at a big-city hospital or clinic, then move to the boonies. ;-) #CAabortion@MSFC I will have paper coming out hopefuly soon explaining why "conscientious objection" in repro healthcare should be banned. #CAabortion@MSFC That's fantastic news, good work!  What prompted this? Inability to get medical schools to improve training? #CAabortion@kaitlynrcarson @MSFC Should be a req't but sadly it's not. Anti-choice healthcare personnel frequently obstruct access. #CAabortion@MSFC Here is CMA policy. The CMAJ "clarified" in 2007 that doctors do not have to give referrals: http://t.co/KMTgVq7Jto #CAabortion@MSFC Many clinics now train new providers, not sure why more hospitals can't do the same? They should. #CAabortion@MSFC Yes and CMA policy is that doctors don't even have to give appropriate referral. NAF has tried to change this, no luck. #CAabortionQuestion: Has training in abortion improved much in Canada over last few years? What's being done? #CAabortion@MSFC We need more new doctors willing to provide services in rural areas, the North, Maritimes, Sask. #CAabortion@MSFC The growing gap between rural and urban services. Access can be excellent in cities, but non-existent outside cities. #CAabortion@KathaMars Yes, stigma is probably less, tho hard to prove causation with lack of laws.
