Check out our annual report! http://t.co/1M2glBnwA6We receive 2,544 individual donations in fiscal year 2012. Our generous supporters make our crucial work possible! THANK YOU!We partner with abortion funds across the country to make abortion accessible in NY. The average parter fund helps us out w/$135.We also partner with clinics to ask for discounts The average clinic discount we receive is about $200 off the cost of the abortion.Almost every person we help contributes something towards cost of their abortion. Average was $355 &amp; most common grantee contribution: $200Our funding process is collaborative. We coordinate resources among grantees, clinics, &amp; abortion funds to ensure our grants go further.Yes, sometimes $25 is all we need to pledge in order for someone to be able to afford the abortion they need!The average NYAAF grant in fiscal year 2012 was $313 and the most common was $200. Max was over $2K, min was $25.The average cost of procedure NYAAF supported in 2012 was $906 and the most common was $500. Most people can't afford this out of pocket.The minimum cost of an abortion procedure supported by NYAAF in fiscal year 2012 was $390. Maximum? $10,000. Could you afford that?In fiscal year 2012, we funded abortions from 4 weeks to 27 weeks. The average was abortions at about 13 weeks.The majority of the people we funded in 2012 did NOT have health insurance at the time they sought an abortion.About half of our grantees in 2012 had children, half did not have children. # of children ranged from one to six.About 75% of NYAAF‚Äôs grantees in 2013 were NYS residents; the remaining 25% travelled to NY from other states for their abortion procedure.NYAAF served grantees aged 12-45 in 2012. Over half of all grantees were in their 20s. This reflects national data on who gets abortions.We started in 1999 when Barnard students volunteering as clinic escorts saw patient leave clinic upset b/c weren't able to pay for abortionAlso of note: We have a new email address!
